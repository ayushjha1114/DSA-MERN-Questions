Yes, you can run scheduled logic inside your microservices, especially if theyâ€™re always online. But using AWS Lambda + EventBridge (or CloudWatch Events) for scheduled jobs has specific benefits in production that often outweigh embedding CRON tasks inside microservices.

Letâ€™s break it down clearly:

âœ… Why Use AWS Lambda for Scheduled Jobs Instead of Microservice Cron?
Criteria	Lambda + EventBridge	Microservice Cron
Simplicity	No server or runtime to manage	Adds complexity to service logic
Scalability	Automatically scales	Fixed resources; may bottleneck
Isolation	Totally independent	Tied to service lifecycle
Reliability	Fully managed & fault-tolerant	Needs manual retries, monitoring
Cost Efficiency	Pay only when invoked	Service runs 24/7
Deployment	Can be deployed separately	Tied to service release
Retries/Failures	Built-in retries, DLQ (Dead Letter Queue)	Must be implemented manually

ðŸ“Œ When Lambda is Better for CRON Jobs:
The task is unrelated to a single microservice
e.g., archiving logs across services every midnight.

You want retries and alerts on failure
Lambda can retry automatically and notify via SNS.

The task should not affect microservice uptime
Imagine a CRON job crashes your payment-service.

You need centralized scheduling for multiple jobs
EventBridge can manage dozens of scheduled triggers cleanly.

ðŸ“Œ When Microservice Cron is OK:
You already run the microservice 24/7

The job is very lightweight (e.g., cleanup temp data every 10 min)

The task is tightly coupled with the microserviceâ€™s logic

You have no need for scaling or retry logic

ðŸ”§ Example:
Imagine you have a billing-service, and you want to run a job that sends invoices every 1st of the month.

Option 1: Inside Microservice (Cron + Node.js/Java Scheduler)
Add CRON job in the app code

Needs to run 24/7

Need to handle retries/failures/logging yourself

Option 2: AWS Lambda + EventBridge
Lambda runs once a month

No downtime risk to billing-service

Can log, alert, and retry automatically

ðŸ§  Conclusion:
You can use CRON in microservices, but for cleaner architecture, better reliability, and lower ops cost, AWS Lambda is the better production-grade solution for scheduled jobs â€” especially in a microservices ecosystem where decoupling matters.
