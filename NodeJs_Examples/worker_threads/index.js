/* ðŸ’¡ Interview Q&A for worker_threads
Q1. Why not use cluster or child_process instead?
Answer:

cluster and child_process create new Node.js processes, each with their own memory heap.

worker_threads create true threads within the same process, allowing lower overhead and shared memory with SharedArrayBuffer.

Use cluster when you want true process isolation (e.g., HTTP server handling).

Use worker_threads when you want to offload CPU-heavy JS tasks without inter-process overhead.

Q2. How do you share memory between threads?
Answer:
Use SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics:

js
Copy
Edit
const shared = new SharedArrayBuffer(4);
const arr = new Int32Array(shared);
Atomics.add(arr, 0, 1);
This allows threads to read/write to the same memory region in a thread-safe way.

Q3. How do you control the number of worker threads to avoid CPU thrashing?
Answer:

Limit threads to os.cpus().length.

Use a worker pool (e.g., via Piscina, a popular worker pool library).

Avoid spawning too many threads at once. Queue tasks and reuse threads.

Q4. What are the trade-offs between worker_threads and message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka?
Aspect	worker_threads	MQ (e.g. RabbitMQ)
Use case	Local CPU-bound work	Distributed async tasks
Overhead	Low	Mediumâ€“High (network, serialization)
Scaling	Limited to one machine	Can scale horizontally
Fault tolerance	Manual	Built-in retry, ack, dead letter queues
Example	Sum calc, image processing	Order processing, email queues

In general, use worker_threads for local performance; use MQs for distributed communication and decoupling. */
