✅ AWS Lambda — Comprehensive Summary
🔷 1. What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute infrastructure.

🚀 Common Use Cases
API backends (with API Gateway)

File processing (e.g., S3 uploads)

Scheduled jobs (with EventBridge or CloudWatch)

Data stream processing (e.g., DynamoDB Streams, Kinesis)

Glue code between services (SNS, SQS, etc.)

Microservices and event-driven architectures

🔷 2. Lambda Cold Starts
❄️ What is a Cold Start?
A cold start happens when AWS:

Creates a new container

Downloads your function code

Starts the runtime

Runs initialization code

This adds latency (100ms–several seconds) to the first invocation.

⚠️ Causes of Cold Starts
First call or after period of inactivity

Large packages or dependencies

Functions inside a VPC

Heavy top-level initialization

Certain languages (e.g., Java, .NET)

🔧 Ways to Reduce Cold Start Time
Use Node.js or Python for faster startup

Avoid VPC unless required (no ENI delay)

Use Provisioned Concurrency (see below)

Reduce package size and dependencies

Move heavy init inside the handler

Use modular Lambdas (smaller, focused functions)

🔷 3. Provisioned Concurrency
🔥 What Is It?
Provisioned Concurrency pre-warms Lambda instances, so they’re always ready to handle requests without cold starts.

✅ Benefits
Eliminates cold start latency

Predictable and consistent performance

Ideal for latency-sensitive applications

💰 Cost Implication
You pay for the pre-warmed instances per GB-second

Plus regular Lambda execution cost

More expensive, but improves UX for critical APIs

🛠 How to Use
AWS CLI:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws lambda put-provisioned-concurrency-config \
  --function-name my-func \
  --qualifier prod \
  --provisioned-concurrent-executions 5
Serverless Framework:

yaml
Copy
Edit
functions:
  myFunc:
    handler: src/handler.main
    provisionedConcurrency: 5
🔷 4. Lambda Layers
📦 What Are Layers?
Layers are separate, shareable packages of libraries, utilities, or binaries that you can attach to one or more Lambda functions.

✅ Benefits
Reuse common code across functions

Reduce function package size

Maintain better separation of concerns

Can include native binaries (e.g., ffmpeg, chromium)

🛠 How to Create & Use
Create a folder (e.g., layer/nodejs/), install packages

Zip it and publish:

bash
Copy
Edit
zip -r layer.zip nodejs
aws lambda publish-layer-version ...
Attach to functions via Console, Serverless, or CDK

Mounted inside /opt at runtime

⚠️ Best Practices
Keep <250 MB unzipped

Don’t include dev dependencies

Use for stable dependencies, not business logic

Use semantic versioning and manage via aliases

🔷 5. Lambda Internals Developers Should Know
Concept	Key Info
Execution Context	Container reused across warm invocations — put DB connections outside handler
Handler Function	The entry point for your code
Environment Variables	Used for configuration, can be encrypted
IAM Role	Lambda runs with an execution role — least privilege principle applies
Observability	Use CloudWatch Logs, AWS X-Ray for tracing, structured logging
Error Handling	Try/catch in handler, use DLQs, retries, and alerts
Deployment Models	Serverless Framework, AWS CDK, Terraform, AWS Console/CLI

🔷 6. Deploying Lambda Functions
A. Serverless Framework
Declarative YAML config (serverless.yml)

Supports layers, events, provisioned concurrency

Simple CLI: sls deploy

B. AWS CDK
Infrastructure as code (TypeScript, Python, etc.)

Fine-grained control of Lambda, API Gateway, IAM

Deploy with cdk deploy

C. AWS CLI / Console
Manual deployment, good for quick tests

Upload ZIP, configure function via console or CLI

🧠 Summary Table
Feature	Description
Cold Starts	Delay on first invocation; reduced via Provisioned Concurrency
Provisioned Concurrency	Pre-warm instances; no cold starts, extra cost
Layers	Shared, versioned code packages (dependencies, binaries)
Deployment	Serverless, CDK, or manual (CLI/Console)
Internals	Execution context reuse, cold/warm lifecycle, IAM, logging
Cost	Based on memory × duration + concurrency charges if used

📌 Final Tips
Use Provisioned Concurrency only where necessary

Keep Lambda packages lightweight

Monitor and alert on errors and timeouts

Secure with IAM roles, Secrets Manager

Use layers for reusability, but version and size them wisely

Consider API Gateway + Lambda for REST or GraphQL APIs
