so the whole sso flow summary is we got token from keycloak after successful login and we use axios interceptor to attach this access token in every api and in backend we use jsonwebtoken and jkws library to decode the token and verify the token using public signature which we get from .well-known/configuration and inside jkws_uri
and in frontend side we store the access token in cookies which is more secure and ttl would be 5 - 15 min

✅ Yes — that’s a solid and correct high-level summary of a secure SSO flow with Keycloak using access tokens.

Here it is cleaned up and expanded slightly for clarity and completeness:

🔐 SSO Flow with Keycloak – End-to-End Summary
✅ 1. User Authentication via Keycloak
User logs in via Keycloak (OIDC flow).

Keycloak redirects back with access_token, id_token, and optionally refresh_token.

✅ 2. Frontend: Token Handling
Access Token is stored securely:

✅ Recommended: HttpOnly secure cookie (prevents XSS access).

Alternative (if needed): In-memory (cleared on refresh), avoid localStorage.

Axios Interceptor adds token to every API request:

ts
Copy
Edit
axios.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = getAccessToken(); // from cookie or in-memory
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
Token TTL: 5–15 minutes (short-lived for safety).

Use refresh_token (in-memory or HttpOnly) + silent renew for re-authentication.

✅ 3. Backend: Token Verification
API receives the Authorization: Bearer <access_token> header.

Uses:

jsonwebtoken to verify the JWT signature and decode claims.

jwks-rsa to fetch and cache Keycloak's public keys.

Public key is retrieved from:

perl
Copy
Edit
https://<keycloak-domain>/realms/<realm-name>/.well-known/openid-configuration
  ↳ jwks_uri: .../protocol/openid-connect/certs
Signature, expiry, issuer, and audience are all verified in middleware.

✅ 4. Access Control & Security
Backend uses claims like:

sub (user ID)

realm_access.roles (RBAC)

exp (expiration time)

Backend does not accept tokens without verifying signature and claims.

Backend does not store refresh tokens.

All traffic is over HTTPS only.

✅ 5. Logout Flow (Optional)
Frontend calls Keycloak's end_session_endpoint.

Clears cookie/session in frontend.

Backend can revoke refresh tokens (if applicable).

🧠 Key Security Practices
Area	Practice
Token storage	Use HttpOnly and Secure cookies or in-memory
Token TTL	Short-lived access tokens (5–15 min)
HTTPS	Mandatory – never expose tokens over HTTP
CORS	Restrict backend to known frontend origins
XSS	Prevent XSS to protect in-memory/cookie tokens
Token validation	Always verify signature + claims (issuer, exp, audience)
