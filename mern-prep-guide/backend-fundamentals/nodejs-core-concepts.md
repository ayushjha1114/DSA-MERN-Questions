# Node.js Core Concepts: EventEmitter and Worker Threads

## 🔹 Understanding EventEmitter in Node.js

## 🌍 1. Why Node.js is Event-Driven

Node.js is designed around non-blocking I/O and uses an event loop to handle many operations concurrently. Instead of waiting for tasks like file reads, network calls, or timers, Node uses events to signal when a task is complete.  
**Event listeners** are core to Node’s architecture—they are the "reaction handlers" for these asynchronous events.

---

## 🧠 2. What Is an Event Listener?

An event listener in Node.js is a callback function registered to listen for a named event on an `EventEmitter` object.  
When the event is emitted, all listeners registered for that event are called synchronously in the order they were registered.

---

## 📦 3. The EventEmitter Class (Node Core Module)

All event-based logic in Node.js revolves around the `EventEmitter` class from the built-in `events` module.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
```

**Registering an Event Listener:**
```javascript
emitter.on('greet', (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});
```

**Emitting the Event:**
```javascript
emitter.emit('greet', 'Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

---

## 🔬 4. How It Works Internally

- `EventEmitter` maintains an internal map: `eventName → [listeners]`.
- When you call `emitter.on('event', listener)`, the listener is pushed to that list.
- When `emit('event')` is called, Node iterates over the list and executes each listener in order.
- Listeners are synchronous by default, unless you explicitly use `setImmediate()` or `process.nextTick()` inside the handler.

---

## 🧰 5. Useful EventEmitter Methods

- `.on(event, listener)` – Register a listener
- `.once(event, listener)` – Register a one-time listener
- `.emit(event, ...args)` – Trigger all listeners
- `.off(event, listener)` – Remove a specific listener (Node 10+)
- `.removeAllListeners(event)` – Useful for cleanup
- `.listenerCount(event)` – Inspect listener state
- `.setMaxListeners(n)` – Avoid memory leak warnings (default is 10)

---

## 💼 6. Real-World Use Cases

### ✅ a) Streams (File, Network, etc.)

Streams in Node emit events like `'data'`, `'end'`, `'error'`:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('./file.txt');

readStream.on('data', chunk => {
  console.log('Received chunk:', chunk);
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Done reading file.');
});
```

### ✅ b) HTTP Servers

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello world');
});

server.on('request', (req, res) => {
  console.log(`Received request for ${req.url}`);
});

server.listen(3000);
```

### ✅ c) Custom Business Logic

You can use `EventEmitter` to decouple modules in an app:

```javascript
// notifier.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
class Notifier extends EventEmitter {}
module.exports = new Notifier();

// billing.js
const notifier = require('./notifier');
notifier.emit('invoicePaid', userId);

// email.js
const notifier = require('./notifier');
notifier.on('invoicePaid', (userId) => {
  // send confirmation email
});
```
> 📌 This creates a loose coupling between the billing and email systems.

---

## ⚠️ 7. Pitfalls and Best Practices

### ❌ Memory Leaks

Adding too many listeners without removing them can cause:

```
(node:12345) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected.
```
**Fix:** Use `emitter.setMaxListeners()` or `.once()` when applicable.

### ✅ Always Clean Up Listeners

In long-running systems (like servers), ensure that listeners are removed if the context they belong to is destroyed.

```javascript
emitter.off('event', listener); // Clean removal
```

### ✅ Use `.once()` for One-Time Events

For things that should only happen once (like DB init, login success, etc.).

---

## 🧩 8. EventEmitter vs Pub/Sub vs Observer Pattern

- **EventEmitter:** Tight coupling (listeners and emitters must know the event name)
- **Pub/Sub (like Redis, RabbitMQ):** Decoupled and scalable across processes or machines

> Use `EventEmitter` within a single process. For microservices or distributed systems, use a true pub/sub mechanism.

---

## 🧪 9. Testing Event Emitters

You can test whether an event was emitted using libraries like Jest:

```javascript
test('emits done', () => {
  const emitter = new MyEmitter();
  const mockFn = jest.fn();
  emitter.on('done', mockFn);
  emitter.doWork(); // supposed to emit 'done'
  expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

---

## 📘 Real World Analogy

Think of an event emitter as a radio station:  
It emits events (like music or news).  
Any number of listeners (radios) can tune in to a specific broadcast.  
When the event happens, everyone listening hears it.

### What is EventEmitter?
`EventEmitter` is a core module in Node.js that allows different parts of your application to communicate asynchronously using events.

### Real-Life Analogy:
- **The band** is the event emitter.
- **The audience** are listeners.
- When the band plays a song (emits an event), the audience responds (listens and reacts).

### Practical Example:
Let’s say you're building a file upload system. When a file is uploaded, you might want to:
- Log the upload
- Send an email
- Resize the image

Instead of calling all those actions directly, you could emit an event called `fileUploaded`, and let other parts of your app handle the response:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

// Listener 1: log upload
emitter.on('fileUploaded', (file) => {
  console.log(`File uploaded: ${file.name}`);
});

// Listener 2: send email
emitter.on('fileUploaded', (file) => {
  console.log(`Sending email about: ${file.name}`);
});

// Emitting the event
const file = { name: 'profile.jpg' };
emitter.emit('fileUploaded', file);
```

---

## 🔹 Building a Mini Express-like Framework with EventEmitter

### Final Output Example:
```javascript
const app = createApp();

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello World!');
});

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Submitted!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### Implementation:
```javascript
const http = require('http');
const EventEmitter = require('events');

function createApp() {
  const emitter = new EventEmitter();

  const app = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    const routeKey = `${req.method} ${req.url}`;
    
    if (emitter.listenerCount(routeKey) > 0) {
      emitter.emit(routeKey, req, res);
    } else {
      res.statusCode = 404;
      res.end('Not Found');
    }
  });

  // Define route methods like get, post, etc.
  app.get = (path, handler) => {
    emitter.on(`GET ${path}`, handler);
  };

  app.post = (path, handler) => {
    emitter.on(`POST ${path}`, handler);
  };

  return app;
}
```

### Try It Out:
```javascript
const app = createApp();

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Hi from GET!');
});

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Received POST!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Mini server running at http://localhost:3000');
});
```

## 🛍️ Real-World Scenario: E-commerce Order Processing System

**Goal:** Build a loosely-coupled system where different parts of the app (payment, inventory, email, analytics) react to an event like `"orderPlaced"`, but they don’t directly depend on each other.

---

### 🧱 System Components

| Component           | Responsibility                        |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Order Service**   | Places the order and emits `orderPlaced` |
| **Inventory Service** | Updates stock levels                  |
| **Email Service**   | Sends order confirmation              |
| **Analytics Service** | Logs event for BI/reporting           |

---

### 🧪 1. `eventBus.js` (Shared EventEmitter)

```javascript
// eventBus.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
class EventBus extends EventEmitter {}
module.exports = new EventBus();
```
> This is a singleton event bus that all modules import and listen to.

---

### 🛒 2. `orderService.js`

```javascript
// orderService.js
const eventBus = require('./eventBus');

function placeOrder(userId, items) {
  // 1. Save order to DB
  console.log(`Order placed by user ${userId} for items`, items);

  // 2. Emit an event
  eventBus.emit('orderPlaced', { userId, items });
}

module.exports = { placeOrder };
```

---

### 📦 3. `inventoryService.js`

```javascript
// inventoryService.js
const eventBus = require('./eventBus');

eventBus.on('orderPlaced', ({ items }) => {
  items.forEach(item => {
    console.log(`Updating inventory for product ${item.productId}`);
    // DB: decrease stock count
  });
});
```

---

### 📧 4. `emailService.js`

```javascript
// emailService.js
const eventBus = require('./eventBus');

eventBus.on('orderPlaced', ({ userId }) => {
  console.log(`Sending order confirmation email to user ${userId}`);
  // Email service integration
});
```

---

### 📊 5. `analyticsService.js`

```javascript
// analyticsService.js
const eventBus = require('./eventBus');

eventBus.on('orderPlaced', ({ userId, items }) => {
  console.log(`Logging analytics for order:`, { userId, items });
  // Push to Kafka/BigQuery/etc.
});
```

---

### 🎯 6. `app.js` (Entry Point)

```javascript
// app.js
require('./inventoryService');
require('./emailService');
require('./analyticsService');

const { placeOrder } = require('./orderService');

placeOrder('user123', [
  { productId: 'P001', quantity: 2 },
  { productId: 'P002', quantity: 1 }
]);
```

---

### ✅ Benefits of This Design

- **Loose Coupling:** `orderService` doesn’t need to know about inventory, email, or analytics.
- **Extendability:** Add more listeners (e.g., SMS service) without touching order logic.
- **Testability:** Each service can be unit-tested by emitting fake events.
- **Performance:** All listeners are triggered synchronously but independently.
- **Clean Separation of Concerns:** Each service does one job.

## 🧠 EventEmitter vs Kafka: What's the Difference?

Think of it like this:

- **EventEmitter** is like talking inside one room—only those present (in the same Node.js process) can hear and react.
- **Kafka** is like broadcasting over a radio channel—other buildings (services) can tune in and receive the message, even if you leave the room.

---

### 🏗️ Real Use Case Comparison: Order Processing

#### 1. 🔧 Using EventEmitter (In-Process, Monolith Style)
- `orderService` emits `orderPlaced`.
- `emailService`, `inventoryService`, etc., listen via a shared `eventBus`.
- All logic runs in the same Node.js process.

**✅ Good for:**  
- Fast prototyping  
- Monolithic apps  
- Single-instance servers

**❌ Limitations:**  
- Not scalable across multiple Node.js processes or containers

---

#### 2. 🛰️ Using Kafka (Distributed Microservices)
- `orderService` produces an `order.placed` event to a Kafka topic.
- Other microservices subscribe (consume) to that topic:
  - `email-service` sends confirmation emails
  - `inventory-service` updates product quantities
  - `analytics-service` logs the order to BigQuery

**✅ Good for:**  
- Decoupled, distributed services  
- Retries and event replay  
- Scalability

**✅ Features:**  
- Built-in logging, monitoring, durability

**❌ Limitations:**  
- Requires infrastructure (Kafka brokers, setup)

## 🔹 What happens if an event handler throws an error?

### Answer:
If an event handler throws an error inside an `EventEmitter`, and the error is not caught, it can crash the Node.js process. Here's a breakdown:

- By default, `EventEmitter` does not handle exceptions in event listeners.
- If an exception is thrown and not caught inside a listener, it propagates and can cause the application to crash (uncaught exception).
- **Special case**: If the error occurs in a listener of the `error` event and there's no listener for `error`, Node.js will throw and terminate the process.

### Example:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on('data', () => {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
});

emitter.emit('data'); // This will crash if not caught
```

### Best Practice:
Always wrap listener logic in `try/catch` if there's a risk of throwing:
```javascript
emitter.on('data', () => {
  try {
    // risky logic
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Handled error:', err);
  }
});
```

---

## 🔹 Can you build a Pub/Sub system using EventEmitter?

### Answer:
Yes, Node.js's built-in `EventEmitter` is a simple way to build a basic Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) system.

- **Publisher** emits events (messages).
- **Subscribers** register callbacks for those events.

### Example:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const pubsub = new EventEmitter();

// Subscriber 1
pubsub.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('Subscriber 1 received:', data);
});

// Subscriber 2
pubsub.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('Subscriber 2 received:', data);
});

// Publisher
pubsub.emit('message', 'Hello, world!');
```

### Limitations:
- It's in-process only — not distributed across multiple machines.
- No support for message persistence or delivery guarantees.

For more robust Pub/Sub systems, consider tools like Redis Pub/Sub, Kafka, RabbitMQ, or NATS.

## 🔹 Understanding Worker Threads in Node.js

### What Are Worker Threads?
Node.js is single-threaded by design. For CPU-intensive tasks like image processing or encryption, `worker_threads` allows you to run JavaScript in parallel on multiple threads.

### When to Use Worker Threads:
- Heavy computations (e.g., crypto, ML, parsing large files)
- Image or video processing
- Avoid blocking the event loop during synchronous tasks

---

## 🔹 Mini Project: Password Hasher with Worker Threads

### Project Structure:
```
password-hasher/
├── main.js            # Express server
├── hasher-worker.js   # Worker thread for hashing
├── package.json
```

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm init -y
npm install express bcrypt
```

### Step 2: Create `hasher-worker.js`
```javascript
const { parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

(async () => {
  try {
    const hashed = await bcrypt.hash(workerData.password, 10);
    parentPort.postMessage({ success: true, hashed });
  } catch (err) {
    parentPort.postMessage({ success: false, error: err.message });
  }
})();
```

### Step 3: Create `main.js`
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

function runHashWorker(password) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const worker = new Worker('./hasher-worker.js', {
      workerData: { password }
    });

    worker.on('message', (msg) => {
      if (msg.success) resolve(msg.hashed);
      else reject(new Error(msg.error));
    });

    worker.on('error', reject);
    worker.on('exit', code => {
      if (code !== 0) reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with code ${code}`));
    });
  });
}

app.post('/hash', async (req, res) => {
  const { password } = req.body;
  if (!password) return res.status(400).send('Password required');

  try {
    const hashed = await runHashWorker(password);
    res.send({ hashed });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).send({ error: err.message });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000'));
```

### Step 4: Test It
Use Postman or curl:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/hash -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"password": "secret123"}'
```
You should get a bcrypt hash back, generated in a worker thread ✅




## 🤝 Difference Between Promise and Promise.all

Both are used to handle asynchronous operations, but they differ in how they behave when dealing with multiple promises.

### ✅ Promise
A `Promise` represents a single asynchronous operation.

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve('Done'), 1000);
});

p.then(console.log); // logs "Done" after 1 sec
```

### ✅ Promise.all
`Promise.all` takes an array of promises and:
- Resolves when **all promises are fulfilled**.
- Rejects immediately if **any one fails**.

```javascript
const p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
const p2 = Promise.resolve(2);
const p3 = Promise.resolve(3);

Promise.all([p1, p2, p3]).then(values => {
  console.log(values); // [1, 2, 3]
});
```

### ❌ If One Fails
If any promise in the array rejects, `Promise.all` fails fast.

```javascript
const p1 = Promise.resolve('A');
const p2 = Promise.reject('Broke');
const p3 = Promise.resolve('C');

Promise.all([p1, p2, p3])
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(err => console.error(err)); // logs "Broke"
```

---

### ⚖️ Promise.all vs Other Promise Aggregators

| **Method**              | **Behavior**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Promise.all()`          | Waits for all to resolve. Fails fast on first rejection.                   |
| `Promise.allSettled()`   | Waits for all. Returns status/result of all (even failed).                 |
| `Promise.race()`         | Returns first resolved/rejected result. Doesn’t wait for all.              |
| `Promise.any()`          | Resolves with first successful one. Only rejects if all fail.             |

---

### 💡 When to Use What?

| **Use Case**                     | **Method**               |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| All must succeed                  | `Promise.all()`          |
| Need all results, even if some failed | `Promise.allSettled()`   |
| Proceed as soon as one completes  | `Promise.race()`         |
| Only care about the first success | `Promise.any()`          |

---

### 🔹 Real-world Scenario: Calling Multiple APIs in Parallel

Imagine a dashboard that shows:
- Weather info (`weatherAPI`)
- News headlines (`newsAPI`)
- Stock prices (`stocksAPI`)

You want to fetch all three simultaneously to improve performance:

```javascript
const [weather, news, stocks] = await Promise.all([
  fetchWeather(),
  fetchNews(),
  fetchStocks()
]);
```

✅ **Why it’s good**: It speeds up loading — no unnecessary waiting.  
❌ **But**: If any one fails, `Promise.all` fails fast, which leads to the next point...

---

### 🔹 Fail-fast Behavior of Promise.all

`Promise.all()` will reject immediately if any promise fails. It doesn’t wait for the others to complete.

```javascript
try {
  const [a, b, c] = await Promise.all([apiA(), apiB(), apiC()]);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('One failed, all failed:', err);
}
```

💡 **Good** when all results are required, but risky if partial success is acceptable.

---

### 🔹 Handling Individual Errors: Promise.allSettled

If you want all results, even if some fail:

```javascript
const results = await Promise.allSettled([
  fetchWeather(),
  fetchNews(),
  fetchStocks()
]);

results.forEach(result => {
  if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {
    console.log('Success:', result.value);
  } else {
    console.error('Failed:', result.reason);
  }
});
```

✅ **Use `allSettled` for**:
- User dashboards
- Background syncing
- Analytics jobs
- Aggregating 3rd-party API data

# Node.js Core Concepts: In-Depth Guide for Senior Developers

---

## 1. Node.js Runtime & Environment

### 🔍 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment** built on **Google's V8 JavaScript engine**. It allows developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js combines the power of C++, JavaScript, and libuv to deliver non-blocking, event-driven server-side functionality.

### ❓ Why It Matters

Understanding the runtime helps avoid performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and incorrect usage of async behavior. It empowers decisions about architecture, library choices, and deployment environments.

### ⚙️ How It Works

Node.js wraps the V8 engine and adds:

* **libuv**: Provides event loop, asynchronous I/O, and thread pooling.
* **Node APIs**: Implemented in C/C++, exposed to JavaScript (e.g., `fs`, `net`, `http`).
* **Bindings**: Connect C++ Node APIs to V8 for JS consumption.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Single JavaScript thread**
* **Asynchronous, non-blocking I/O**
* **Interoperability with system resources (file system, network, etc.)**

---

## 2. Node.js Architecture (Single-threaded, Event Loop)

### ❓ What is the Architecture?

Node.js operates on a **single-threaded event loop model** with a background worker thread pool for heavy I/O.

### ❓ Why It Exists

JavaScript was designed to be single-threaded for simplicity. Node.js leverages this with asynchronous I/O to manage high concurrency without multithreading complexity.

### ⚙️ How It Works

* JavaScript code runs on a single thread (main event loop).
* I/O and expensive operations are offloaded to background threads (via **libuv**).
* Once complete, callbacks are queued and executed on the main thread.

### 🧠 Implication

* Avoid CPU-heavy tasks on the main thread (use Worker Threads or offload to external services).
* Good for I/O-heavy workloads: web servers, APIs, streaming.

---

## 3. Call Stack, Event Loop, Callback Queue

### ❓ What Are These?

These components control **execution flow** in Node.js:

* **Call Stack**: The execution context stack (LIFO).
* **Event Loop**: The mechanism that schedules asynchronous code.
* **Callback Queue**: Queues up callbacks from async tasks to be executed by the event loop.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```javascript
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("nextTick"));
console.log("End");
```

**Output:**

```
Start
End
nextTick
Promise
Timeout
```

* `process.nextTick()` runs **before** Promises.
* Promises run in **microtask queue**.
* `setTimeout` runs in **macro task queue** after call stack clears.

### ❓ Why It Matters

Misunderstanding execution order leads to race conditions, missed optimizations, and unresponsive apps.

---

## 4. Libuv & Non-blocking I/O

### ❓ What is libuv?

**libuv** is a multi-platform C library that Node.js uses for:

* Asynchronous I/O
* Event loop
* Thread pooling
* File system & DNS abstraction
* TCP/UDP networking

### ⚙️ How It Works

Blocking tasks (e.g., file I/O) are offloaded to a **thread pool** (default size: 4). Upon completion, a callback is placed in the event loop queue.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Done reading');
});
```

### ❓ Why It Matters

Node.js is not truly single-threaded—libuv's thread pool runs in the background. Knowing this helps when tuning concurrency and thread pool size.

### ⚠️ Tuning Tips

* Use `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` to increase thread pool size for heavy I/O apps.
* Avoid synchronous functions (`fs.readFileSync`) on the main thread.

---

## 5. Global Objects (\_\_dirname, \_\_filename, process, etc.)

### ❓ What Are They?

Node.js provides global variables and objects without requiring imports.

| Global         | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `__dirname`    | Directory of the current module            |
| `__filename`   | Full path to the current module            |
| `process`      | Process-level info, environment, lifecycle |
| `global`       | Like `window` in the browser               |
| `Buffer`       | For working with binary data               |
| `setImmediate` | Executes after current event loop phase    |

### ⚙️ How & Why To Use Them

```js
console.log(__dirname);              // Useful for path resolution
console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV);  // Environment config
process.on('exit', code => console.log('Exiting:', code));
```

* Use `process.env` for **environment-specific configurations**.
* Use `__dirname`/`__filename` for safe **file path handling**.
* Use `Buffer` when dealing with streams, binary protocols, or raw I/O.

### 🧠 Real-world Use Cases

* `.env` based configuration using `dotenv`
* Graceful shutdown using `process.on('SIGTERM')`
* Serving static files with proper `__dirname` resolution

---

## 6. 🧠 Performance & Internals

### 🔄 Event Loop Internals (Phases, Timers, Microtasks)

#### ❓ What It Is

The event loop is the heartbeat of Node.js. It manages when and how callbacks are executed.

#### ⚙️ How It Works

Node.js's event loop has multiple phases:

1. **Timers Phase**: Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.
2. **Pending Callbacks Phase**: Executes I/O callbacks deferred from the previous cycle.
3. **Idle/Prepare Phase**: Only for internal use.
4. **Poll Phase**: Waits for new I/O events; executes immediate I/O callbacks.
5. **Check Phase**: Executes `setImmediate` callbacks.
6. **Close Callbacks Phase**: Executes callbacks like `socket.on('close')`.

In between these phases:

* **Microtasks** (like `Promise.then`, `queueMicrotask`) are executed **after each phase**.
* `process.nextTick` runs **before microtasks**.

#### 🧠 Why It Matters

Mastery of event loop timing helps avoid unexpected bugs, especially with multiple timers, promises, and I/O.

---

### 🧵 Node.js Clustering & Multi-threading

#### ❓ What It Is

* **Cluster Module**: Allows Node.js to spawn child processes (forks) that share the same server port.
* **Worker Threads**: Provides actual multi-threading within a single process.

#### ⚙️ How It Works

* **Cluster**: Uses `child_process.fork()` and load balances incoming connections using round-robin.

```js
const cluster = require('cluster');
if (cluster.isMaster) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) cluster.fork();
} else {
  require('./server');
}
```

* **Worker Threads**: Runs CPU-intensive JS in parallel.

```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
new Worker('./heavy-task.js');
```

#### 🧠 Why It Matters

Cluster is ideal for scaling network-bound apps. Worker threads are for CPU-bound logic (e.g., image processing, data crunching).

### 🚀 V8 Optimizations

#### ❓ What It Is

V8 is the engine behind Node.js that compiles JavaScript to machine code using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

#### ⚙️ How It Works

* Optimizes frequently used functions (hot code).
* Performs inlining, dead code elimination, hidden classes, and escape analysis.
* Falls back to interpreted code on de-optimization.

#### 🧠 Why It Matters

Understanding V8 helps in writing performance-critical code.

**Tips:**

* Avoid polymorphism (inconsistent property usage).
* Pre-allocate arrays or buffers.
* Don’t abuse `arguments` or `eval`.
* Use `let`/`const` over `var`.

---

### 🧹 Garbage Collection in Node.js

#### ❓ What It Is

Automatic memory management by V8 through generational garbage collection.

#### ⚙️ How It Works

* V8 uses **generational GC**:

  * **New Space (Young Gen)**: Short-lived objects.
  * **Old Space (Tenured Gen)**: Long-lived objects.
* Minor GC: Fast, runs often on young gen.
* Major GC: Slow, scans entire heap.

#### 🧠 Why It Matters

Improper memory handling causes GC pauses and leaks.

**Tips:**

* Avoid holding unnecessary references.
* Use tools like `--inspect`, `heapdump`, `v8-profiler`, `clinic.js` to monitor memory.
* Trigger GC manually only in diagnostics: `--expose-gc`, then `global.gc()`.

## 1. Node.js Runtime & Environment

### 🔍 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment** built on **Google's V8 JavaScript engine**. It allows developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js combines the power of C++, JavaScript, and libuv to deliver non-blocking, event-driven server-side functionality.

### ❓ Why It Matters

Understanding the runtime helps avoid performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and incorrect usage of async behavior. It empowers decisions about architecture, library choices, and deployment environments.

### ⚙️ How It Works

Node.js wraps the V8 engine and adds:

* **libuv**: Provides event loop, asynchronous I/O, and thread pooling.
* **Node APIs**: Implemented in C/C++, exposed to JavaScript (e.g., `fs`, `net`, `http`).
* **Bindings**: Connect C++ Node APIs to V8 for JS consumption.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Single JavaScript thread**
* **Asynchronous, non-blocking I/O**
* **Interoperability with system resources (file system, network, etc.)**

---

## 2. Node.js Architecture (Single-threaded, Event Loop)

### ❓ What is the Architecture?

Node.js operates on a **single-threaded event loop model** with a background worker thread pool for heavy I/O.

### ❓ Why It Exists

JavaScript was designed to be single-threaded for simplicity. Node.js leverages this with asynchronous I/O to manage high concurrency without multithreading complexity.

### ⚙️ How It Works

* JavaScript code runs on a single thread (main event loop).
* I/O and expensive operations are offloaded to background threads (via **libuv**).
* Once complete, callbacks are queued and executed on the main thread.

### 🧠 Implication

* Avoid CPU-heavy tasks on the main thread (use Worker Threads or offload to external services).
* Good for I/O-heavy workloads: web servers, APIs, streaming.

---

## 3. Call Stack, Event Loop, Callback Queue

### ❓ What Are These?

These components control **execution flow** in Node.js:

* **Call Stack**: The execution context stack (LIFO).
* **Event Loop**: The mechanism that schedules asynchronous code.
* **Callback Queue**: Queues up callbacks from async tasks to be executed by the event loop.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```javascript
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("nextTick"));
console.log("End");
```

**Output:**

```
Start
End
nextTick
Promise
Timeout
```

* `process.nextTick()` runs **before** Promises.
* Promises run in **microtask queue**.
* `setTimeout` runs in **macro task queue** after call stack clears.

### ❓ Why It Matters

Misunderstanding execution order leads to race conditions, missed optimizations, and unresponsive apps.

---

## 4. Libuv & Non-blocking I/O

### ❓ What is libuv?

**libuv** is a multi-platform C library that Node.js uses for:

* Asynchronous I/O
* Event loop
* Thread pooling
* File system & DNS abstraction
* TCP/UDP networking

### ⚙️ How It Works

Blocking tasks (e.g., file I/O) are offloaded to a **thread pool** (default size: 4). Upon completion, a callback is placed in the event loop queue.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Done reading');
});
```

### ❓ Why It Matters

Node.js is not truly single-threaded—libuv's thread pool runs in the background. Knowing this helps when tuning concurrency and thread pool size.

### ⚠️ Tuning Tips

* Use `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` to increase thread pool size for heavy I/O apps.
* Avoid synchronous functions (`fs.readFileSync`) on the main thread.

---

## 5. Global Objects (\_\_dirname, \_\_filename, process, etc.)

### ❓ What Are They?

Node.js provides global variables and objects without requiring imports.

| Global         | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `__dirname`    | Directory of the current module            |
| `__filename`   | Full path to the current module            |
| `process`      | Process-level info, environment, lifecycle |
| `global`       | Like `window` in the browser               |
| `Buffer`       | For working with binary data               |
| `setImmediate` | Executes after current event loop phase    |

### ⚙️ How & Why To Use Them

```js
console.log(__dirname);              // Useful for path resolution
console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV);  // Environment config
process.on('exit', code => console.log('Exiting:', code));
```

* Use `process.env` for **environment-specific configurations**.
* Use `__dirname`/`__filename` for safe **file path handling**.
* Use `Buffer` when dealing with streams, binary protocols, or raw I/O.

### 🧠 Real-world Use Cases

* `.env` based configuration using `dotenv`
* Graceful shutdown using `process.on('SIGTERM')`
* Serving static files with proper `__dirname` resolution

## 7. 🧰 Streams

### 📖 What Are Streams?

Streams are abstract interfaces for working with streaming data in Node.js. They're instances of `EventEmitter` and allow **data processing chunk-by-chunk** instead of loading it all at once into memory.

### 💡 Why Streams Matter

Efficient for large file I/O, network transmission, or transformation tasks like video encoding. Helps with memory usage and performance.

### 🔄 Types of Streams

* **Readable**: Source of data (e.g., `fs.createReadStream`)
* **Writable**: Destination of data (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream`)
* **Duplex**: Both readable and writable (e.g., TCP socket)
* **Transform**: Duplex + transformation (e.g., Gzip compression)

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const read = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
const write = fs.createWriteStream('copy.txt');
read.pipe(write);
```

### ⏱️ Backpressure

Occurs when the writable stream can't consume data as fast as readable stream produces.

```js
const stream = require('stream');
readable.pipe(writable, { end: false });
```

Node handles this via `.pause()`, `.resume()`, and internal buffering.

### 🔄 Piping Streams

Connect output of one stream to another. Simplifies transformation pipelines.

```js
readable.pipe(transform).pipe(writable);
```

Useful for:

* Compression (Gzip)
* Encryption
* Parsing CSV/JSON/NDJSON

---

## 8. 🔒 Security

### 🛡️ Input Validation & Sanitization

Always validate and sanitize input, especially in REST or GraphQL APIs.

* Use libraries like `Joi`, `zod`, `express-validator`
* Prevent NoSQL/SQL injection

```js
const Joi = require('joi');
const schema = Joi.object({ username: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).required() });
```

### 💥 Preventing Memory Leaks

* Dereference unused objects
* Use `WeakMap`/`WeakRef`
* Monitor heap snapshots

Use tools like:

* Chrome DevTools (`--inspect`)
* `heapdump`
* `clinic.js`

### 📉 Rate Limiting

Prevent abuse by limiting requests:

* Use `express-rate-limit`
* Implement IP-based or token-based quotas

```js
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
app.use(rateLimit({ windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 }));
```

### 🔐 HTTPS & TLS/SSL

Use `https` module or reverse proxies (e.g., NGINX) for TLS.

* Always redirect HTTP to HTTPS
* Rotate TLS keys
* Use `helmet` for common HTTP headers

### ☠️ CSRF/XSS in Backend APIs

* CSRF: Use tokens for stateful APIs
* XSS: Sanitize output, use Content Security Policy

---

## 9. 🌐 Networking

### 🔌 TCP & UDP (Net, Dgram)

* **TCP (net module)**: Reliable, ordered, stream-based communication

```js
const net = require('net');
net.createServer(socket => socket.write('Hello')).listen(3000);
```

* **UDP (dgram module)**: Fast, connectionless

```js
const dgram = require('dgram');
const socket = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
socket.send('Hello', 41234, 'localhost');
```

### 🧵 WebSockets

Enable full-duplex communication between client/server.

* `ws`: Lightweight and low-level

```js
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const server = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });
```

* `Socket.IO`: Adds room support, reconnection, fallback protocols

Use when you need:

* Real-time apps (chats, games)
* Live data (stocks, feeds)

### 🚀 HTTP/2 Support

* Built-in Node.js support via `http2` module
* Multiplexing: multiple streams per connection
* Server push capabilities

```js
const http2 = require('http2');
http2.createSecureServer({ cert, key }, onRequest);
```

---

## 10. 🛠️ Process & Threads

### 👶 `child_process` Module

Spawn new OS processes (shell commands, subprocesses)

```js
const { exec, spawn } = require('child_process');
exec('ls -la', (err, stdout) => console.log(stdout));
```

Use `spawn` for streams, `exec` for buffered output.

### 🧵 `worker_threads`

True multi-threading within Node.js for CPU-bound work.

```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
new Worker('./worker.js');
```

Best for:

* CPU-heavy JSON parsing
* Math calculations
* Encryption tasks

### 🔄 Spawning vs Forking

* **Spawn**: Launch any executable with streaming I/O
* **Fork**: Specialized spawn for Node.js child scripts

```js
const { fork } = require('child_process');
fork('child.js');
```

### ⚙️ Parallelism in Node.js

* Use `Promise.all` for async I/O concurrency
* Use `cluster` or `worker_threads` for CPU-parallelism
* Thread pool can handle background libuv tasks (e.g., crypto, fs)

## Node.js Event Loop, V8, and libuv: How They Work Together

### ✅ Is the Event Loop implemented in libuv?
Yes — the Event Loop is implemented as an algorithm within the [libuv](https://libuv.org/) C library.

#### 🔧 In Detail
- The event loop is a C-based implementation in libuv (`uv_run()` and related functions).
- It is **not** implemented in JavaScript.
- Node.js exposes the event loop’s behavior to JavaScript, but the orchestration of phases, polling, and callbacks is handled by libuv.

#### 📚 Source Reference
- **libuv** is the event-driven I/O library Node.js uses under the hood.
- Core loop logic: `libuv/src/unix/core.c` (`uv_run`)

#### 🔄 What Does libuv’s Event Loop Do?
The event loop algorithm in libuv handles:
- Timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)
- Pending callbacks
- Idle, prepare
- Poll for I/O events
- Check (`setImmediate`)
- Close callbacks
- Handles I/O completion via the thread pool

It uses `select()`, `epoll()`, or `kqueue()` (depending on platform) to wait for I/O events in the poll phase.

#### 🧠 Example: Core Loop (Pseudocode)
```c
int uv_run(uv_loop_t* loop, uv_run_mode mode) {
    while (!done) {
        uv_update_time(loop);
        uv__run_timers(loop);         // Timers phase
        uv__run_pending(loop);        // Pending callbacks
        uv__run_idle(loop);           // Idle
        uv__run_prepare(loop);        // Prepare phase
        uv__poll(loop);               // I/O polling
        uv__run_check(loop);          // setImmediate
        uv__run_closing_handles(loop);// close events
    }
}
```
This closely matches Node.js’s conceptual event loop phases.

#### 🔎 Summary Table

| Concept                        | Implemented In | Location                |
|---------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| Event Loop Algorithm            | C             | libuv                   |
| JS Bindings (e.g. setTimeout)   | JS + C++      | Node.js source          |
| Exposed via                     | Node.js APIs  | `timers.js`, `next_tick.js` |

#### 🔧 Node.js vs libuv Responsibilities

## 🧠 Scenario: No Browser, Just Node.js — Will Promises Work?

**Q:** You don’t have Chrome or any browser installed. Can you run Node.js code using Promises?

### ✅ Short Answer
Yes — Promises work in Node.js without any browser because Node.js embeds its own copy of the V8 engine.

### 🔍 Long Answer: V8 Is Not Just for Browsers

| Component | What It Is                                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| V8        | Google’s JavaScript engine (compiles JS to machine code) |
| Chrome    | Browser that embeds V8 to run frontend JS       |
| Node.js   | Runtime that embeds V8 to run backend JS        |
| libuv     | C library for async I/O and event loop          |

**Node.js is fully self-contained:**
- Includes V8 (runs JS, manages Promises, async/await)
- C++ runtime with libuv (async I/O, threads)
- JS standard library (fs, http, etc.)

#### 🧪 Example: Promises Without a Browser
```js
console.log('Start');

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log('Resolved Promise');
});

console.log('End');
```
**Output:**
```
Start
End
Resolved Promise
```
- `Promise.resolve().then()` is handled by V8 (bundled in Node.js)
- No browser required

#### 🛠️ How Node.js Uses V8

```
┌────────────┐
│ Your Code  │
└────┬───────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ V8 Engine   │ ← handles Promises, async/await, JS execution
└────┬────────┘
         │

│ Node C++ API │ ← built-in modules like fs, http, crypto
├──────────────┤
│ libuv        │ ← handles file I/O, timers, network
└──────────────┘
```

- V8 compiles and executes JS (including Promises)
- libuv handles I/O and async work (not Promises themselves)

#### 📦 Where Is V8 Inside Node.js?
- Node.js includes a compiled binary of V8.
- Verify with:
    ```bash
    node -p "process.versions.v8"
    ```
    Example output: `12.22.5`

|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Is V8 only in browsers like Chrome? | ❌ No, it’s embedded in Node.js too     |
| Can Promises run without a browser? | ✅ Yes, because Node.js includes V8     |
| Who executes Promise logic?         | ✅ V8 engine (part of Node.js)          |
| Is libuv involved in Promise scheduling? | ❌ No, microtask queue is handled by V8 |

---

## Key Concepts Recap

### 🔹 V8
- Compiles and executes JavaScript
- Manages call stack, heap, and microtask queue (Promises, async/await)
- Used in both Chrome and Node.js

### 🔹 libuv
- C library: event loop, I/O, timers, thread pool, async hooks
- Handles long-running operations: file access, DNS, TCP, etc.

## 🔂 Async/Await and Promises in Detail

### 🔹 Example
```js
console.log('Start');

async function test() {
    console.log('Inside async');
    await null;
    console.log('After await');
}

test();

console.log('End');
```
**Execution Breakdown:**
1. `console.log('Start')` — printed immediately
2. `async function test()` is called — logs "Inside async"
3. Hits `await null` — like `Promise.resolve(null).then(...)`
4. Continuation (`console.log('After await')`) is put into V8’s microtask queue
5. `console.log('End')` — executed next
6. V8 drains microtask queue — "After await" is printed

**Output:**
```
Start
Inside async
End
After await
```

---

### 🔧 How libuv Fits In

```js
const fs = require('fs');

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Timeout');
}, 0);

fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
    console.log('File read');
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log('Promise');
});

console.log('End');
```

**Execution Order:**
- `console.log('End')` → Immediate
- `Promise.then(...)` → Added to V8’s microtask queue
- `setTimeout` → Added to libuv's timers queue
- `fs.readFile` → Handled by libuv thread pool, then scheduled
- Microtasks run: `console.log('Promise')`
- Macrotasks (timers and poll): Eventually "Timeout", then "File read"

**Output:**
```
End
Promise
Timeout
File read
```

### 🔍 Event Loop Phases Overview (libuv)

| Phase      | What Happens                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Timers     | Executes `setTimeout` and `setInterval`     |
| Pending    | I/O callbacks waiting to be executed        |
| Idle/Prepare | Internal use                              |
| Poll       | Retrieves new I/O events; runs fs, net, etc |
| Check      | Executes `setImmediate()` callbacks         |
| Close      | Runs cleanup code for closed sockets/files  |
| Repeats... | Each tick handles microtasks at the end     |

---

### 📦 Microtasks Queue in V8

**Microtasks:**
- `Promise.then()`
- `await`
- `queueMicrotask()`
- `process.nextTick()` (Node.js only; runs before other microtasks)

- Stored in a special microtask queue
- Drained after each synchronous or macrotask phase
- Run before the event loop continues to the next phase

### 🧵 Visual Timeline (Simplified)

```js
console.log('A')
Promise.then(() => console.log('B'))
setTimeout(() => console.log('C'), 0)
fs.readFile(..., () => console.log('D'))
console.log('E')
```

**Queues:**
- Microtasks: `[() => console.log('B')]`
- Timer queue: `[() => console.log('C')]`
- Poll queue: `[() => console.log('D')]`

**Execution order:**
```
A
E
B   ← Microtask (V8)
C   ← Timer (libuv)
D   ← I/O (libuv)
```

# Node.js: Async Execution, Worker Threads, and Event Loop Starvation

## 1. 🔍 Visualize Async Execution with `async_hooks`

Node.js provides the built-in [`async_hooks`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html) module to track the lifecycle of asynchronous operations, such as:

- Promises
- File I/O
- Timers
- `await`

### 🧪 Example: Tracking Async Operations

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const async_hooks = require('async_hooks');

const hook = async_hooks.createHook({
    init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId) {
        console.log(`INIT: [${type}] id=${asyncId} trigger=${triggerAsyncId}`);
    },
    before(asyncId) {
        console.log(`BEFORE: id=${asyncId}`);
    },
    after(asyncId) {
        console.log(`AFTER: id=${asyncId}`);
    },
    destroy(asyncId) {
        console.log(`DESTROY: id=${asyncId}`);
    },
});

hook.enable();

fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
    console.log('File read complete');
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log('Promise resolved');
});

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Timer fired');
}, 10);
```

**What You'll See:**  
This logs when Promises, file reads, and timers are created, run, and destroyed, showing their `asyncId` and type (e.g., `PROMISE`, `TIMERWRAP`, `FSREQCALLBACK`).

---

## 2. ⚙️ How `async/await` Is Compiled (Desugaring)

When you write:

```js
async function foo() {
    await bar();
    console.log('done');
}
```

V8 transforms it into:

```js
function foo() {
    return bar().then(() => {
        console.log('done');
    });
}
```

- `await` is syntactic sugar for `.then()` on a Promise.
- The parser emits a state machine to suspend/resume execution.
- The rest of the function after `await` is placed in a closure to resume later.
- The call stack is popped, and V8 adds the callback to the microtask queue.

---

## 📌 Part 1: Worker Threads — True Parallelism in Node.js

### 🔧 Why Use Worker Threads?

Node.js is single-threaded by default (great for I/O, bad for CPU-bound tasks):

- JSON/XML parsing of large payloads
- Video/audio encoding
- Data compression
- Hashing or cryptography

Worker threads enable actual parallelism using multiple V8 instances.

### 🧵 Example: Running a Heavy Task in a Worker

**main.js:**
```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

const worker = new Worker('./worker-task.js');

worker.on('message', (msg) => {
    console.log('Message from worker:', msg);
});

worker.postMessage('start');
```

**worker-task.js:**
```js
const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

parentPort.on('message', (msg) => {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) count += i;
    parentPort.postMessage(`Done: ${count}`);
});
```

✅ Main thread stays responsive; heavy task runs in parallel.

### ⚙️ Key Features of Worker Threads

| Feature                        | Description                        |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Dedicated V8 & Event Loop       | Each worker has its own context    |
| No shared memory (by default)   | Isolated like processes            |
| Can share with SharedArrayBuffer| For advanced memory sharing        |
| Communicate via messages        | Like web workers                   |
| Supports ES Modules             | Use `{ type: 'module' }` option    |

**Best Practices:**

- Use for CPU-bound, not I/O-bound work.
- Use a worker pool for concurrent tasks.
- Avoid creating/destroying threads repeatedly.
- Consider libraries like [Piscina](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina) for pooling.

---

## 📌 Part 2: Event Loop Starvation in Node.js

### ⚠️ What Is Event Loop Starvation?

Event loop starvation occurs when the event loop is blocked from executing I/O, timers, or callbacks, usually because:

- Long, synchronous JavaScript code
- Endless microtask queue (Promises)

**Effects:**

- High latency
- Slow/unresponsive servers
- Missed timers or delayed responses

### 🔁 Quick Recap: Event Loop Phases

The Node.js event loop (via libuv) runs through these phases:

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│      timers                │  ← setTimeout, setInterval
├────────────────────────────┤
│      pending callbacks     │
├────────────────────────────┤
│      idle, prepare         │
├────────────────────────────┤
│      poll                  │  ← I/O polling
├────────────────────────────┤
│      check                 │  ← setImmediate
├────────────────────────────┤
│      close callbacks       │
└────────────────────────────┘
```
*Microtasks (Promise.then, queueMicrotask) run after every phase, before the next tick begins.*

---

### 🔥 Real Example of Starvation

```js
const http = require('http');

function blockCpu(ms) {
    const end = Date.now() + ms;
    while (Date.now() < end); // busy-wait
}

http.createServer((req, res) => {
    if (req.url === '/block') {
        blockCpu(5000); // blocks event loop!
        res.end('Done blocking\n');
    } else {
        res.end('Hello\n');
    }
}).listen(3000);

console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
```

*Hit `/block` in one tab, and `/` in another — the second request hangs for 5 seconds!*

---

### 🧠 Microtask Starvation Example

```js
function spamMicrotasks() {
    Promise.resolve().then(spamMicrotasks);
}

spamMicrotasks(); // starves event loop
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('This will never run');
}, 1000);
```
*The microtask queue never empties, so timers are never reached.*

---

### 🧰 Diagnosing Starvation

1. **Use `--trace-event-categories`:**
     ```bash
     node --trace-event-categories node.perf eventloopstarve.js
     ```
     Open the generated `node_trace.1.log` in `chrome://tracing`.

2. **Monitor with `eventLoopUtilization`:**
     ```js
     const { performance, monitorEventLoopDelay } = require('perf_hooks');

     const h = monitorEventLoopDelay({ resolution: 10 });
     h.enable();

     setInterval(() => {
         console.log(`ELU: ${performance.eventLoopUtilization().util.toFixed(4)}`);
         console.log(`Lag: ${h.mean / 1e6} ms`);
     }, 1000);
     ```
     *High utilization or large mean delay = signs of starvation.*

---

### 🛠️ Mitigation Techniques

| Strategy                      | When to Use                        |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `setImmediate()`              | Yield to event loop (between phases)|
| `setTimeout(fn, 0)`           | Yield to next timer phase          |
| `queueMicrotask()`            | Schedule lightweight continuation  |
| Break long loops              | Process chunks over multiple ticks |
| Use Worker Threads            | For CPU-heavy operations           |
| Use `child_process`/native    | When feasible                      |

#### Example: Yielding With `setImmediate`

```js
function longTask(done) {
    let i = 0;
    function step() {
        if (i >= 1e9) return done();
        i++;
        if (i % 1e6 === 0) setImmediate(step); // yield!
        else step();
    }
    step();
}
```

---

### ✅ TL;DR Summary

- The event loop can be starved by long sync tasks or microtasks.
- Starvation = delayed timers, I/O, poor responsiveness.
- Use profiling, `eventLoopUtilization()`, and `monitorEventLoopDelay()` to detect it.
- Use chunking, `setImmediate`, or Worker Threads to prevent it.

---

## ✅ Scenario: Server Gets Stuck on Heavy CPU Task

### 🧪 Goal

Compare two endpoints:

- `/block` – blocks the event loop with a long CPU task
- `/non-block` – does the same task in non-blocking chunks using `setImmediate`

### ✅ Code: `server.js`

```js
const http = require('http');

// Simulate heavy CPU work that blocks the event loop
function blockCpu(ms) {
    const end = Date.now() + ms;
    while (Date.now() < end); // Blocking busy loop
}

// Chunked (non-blocking) version using setImmediate
function nonBlockingTask(total, chunkSize, done) {
    let count = 0;

    function runChunk() {
        const start = Date.now();
        while (count < total && (Date.now() - start) < chunkSize) {
            count++;
        }

        if (count < total) {
            setImmediate(runChunk); // Yield control to event loop
        } else {
            done();
        }
    }

    runChunk();
}

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    const start = Date.now();

    if (req.url === '/block') {
        blockCpu(5000); // Blocks for 5 seconds
        return res.end(`Blocking task done in ${Date.now() - start} ms\n`);
    }

    if (req.url === '/non-block') {
        nonBlockingTask(1e8, 10, () => {
            res.end(`Non-blocking task done in ${Date.now() - start} ms\n`);
        });
        return;
    }

    res.end('Hello from Node.js\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000');
});
```

#### 🧪 Test Instructions

1. Open two terminal tabs or browser windows.
2. In tab 1, visit:  
     `http://localhost:3000/block`
3. In tab 2, visit:  
     `http://localhost:3000/` or `http://localhost:3000/non-block`

#### 🔍 Results

| Endpoint    | Behavior                                                      |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/block`    | Blocks entire event loop. Other requests are delayed or stuck |
| `/non-block`| Processes large task without blocking event loop. Others OK   |

---

### ✅ Bonus: Measure Event Loop Delay (Optional)

Add this to the top of your file to monitor delay:

```js
const { monitorEventLoopDelay } = require('perf_hooks');
const delay = monitorEventLoopDelay({ resolution: 20 });
delay.enable();

setInterval(() => {
    console.log(`Mean Event Loop Delay: ${(delay.mean / 1e6).toFixed(2)} ms`);
}, 1000);
```

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Avoid blocking loops in the main thread.
- Use `setImmediate()` or `setTimeout()` to yield control.
- Monitor the event loop using `perf_hooks`.
- For heavy CPU: use Worker Threads.



# 📌 Part 3: Memory Management & Garbage Collection in Node.js

Understanding memory management is essential for:

- How your app uses memory
- How V8 reclaims it
- What causes memory leaks
- How to diagnose and fix them

---

## 🧠 How Memory Is Managed in Node.js

Node.js uses the V8 engine, which provides:

- Automatic memory allocation
- Automatic garbage collection (GC)

---

## 🧱 Main Memory Regions

| Region        | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Heap          | For objects, closures, strings, arrays      |
| Stack         | For function calls, primitives              |
| C++ bindings  | Memory allocated by Node or native modules  |
| Buffers       | Large memory used for I/O, streams          |

---

## 🔄 Garbage Collection in V8

V8’s GC Strategy (Node.js 18–20+):

- **Scavenge (Minor GC):** Fast collection in young generation
- **Mark-and-Sweep (Major GC):** Deep scan in old generation
- **Incremental/Concurrent GC:** Avoid blocking the event loop
- **Idle GC:** Run GC when the system is idle

---

## 📦 Memory Generations

| Generation   | What’s Stored Here?             | Collected By |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Young        | New objects, short-lived data   | Minor GC     |
| Old          | Long-lived/promoted objects     | Major GC     |
| Large Object | Buffers, typed arrays, images   | Major GC     |

---

## 📈 Default Memory Limits (Node.js)

| Platform        | Default Max Heap |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| 64-bit Node     | ~1.5 GB         |
| 32-bit Node     | ~0.7 GB         |

Increase with:

```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 app.js
```

---

## 🧪 Memory Leak Example

```js
let leaky = [];

setInterval(() => {
    const big = Buffer.alloc(1e6); // 1 MB
    leaky.push(big);
    console.log(`Memory: ${(process.memoryUsage().heapUsed / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2)} MB`);
}, 100);
```
*Eventually crashes with “heap out of memory”*

---

## 🧰 Tools for Memory Diagnostics

1. **process.memoryUsage()**
     ```js
     console.log(process.memoryUsage());
     ```

2. **--inspect with Chrome DevTools**
     ```bash
     node --inspect app.js
     ```
     Open Chrome → `chrome://inspect` → open debugger → take heap snapshot, record allocation timelines.

3. **heapdump Module**
     ```js
     const heapdump = require('heapdump');
     heapdump.writeSnapshot('./my-app.heapsnapshot');
     ```
     Analyze in Chrome DevTools.

4. **clinic.js (by NearForm)**
     ```bash
     npx clinic doctor -- node app.js
     ```
     Gives CPU, memory, event loop stats in a single report.

---

## 🛠️ Best Practices to Avoid Memory Leaks

| Pattern                | Example                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Avoid global arrays    | `globalList.push(hugeData)`      |
| Remove listeners       | `emitter.removeListener()`        |
| Clean up timers        | `clearInterval`, `clearTimeout`   |
| Don’t retain closures  | Avoid closure over large scopes   |
| Use WeakMap/WeakRef    | Store non-critical data           |
| Monitor memory regularly | `process.memoryUsage()`, clinic.js |

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Topic             | Insight                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| GC in Node.js     | Done by V8 using generational GC                |
| Memory types      | Stack, Heap, Buffers, Native                    |
| Common leaks      | Closures, global variables, uncleaned timers/listeners |
| Diagnostic tools  | Chrome DevTools, heapdump, clinic.js, process.memoryUsage() |
| Prevention        | Track memory, profile in prod, use weak references for cached data |

# 🚦 Graceful Shutdown & Signal Handling

## ❓ Why Graceful Shutdown Matters

In production, your app can be killed at any time (deploy, crash, container eviction).  
Without proper shutdown:

- In-flight requests are dropped
- DB connections leak
- Queues get stuck
- Logs may be lost

---

## ✅ Common Signals You Must Handle

| Signal  | Meaning         | Sent by                |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| SIGINT  | Interrupt (Ctrl+C) | Terminal/user      |
| SIGTERM | Termination     | Docker, systemd        |
| SIGHUP  | Hangup          | Supervisor tools       |

---

## 🧠 What You Must Clean Up

- HTTP server (`server.close`)
- DB connections (Mongo, Postgres, Redis)
- Workers (Bull, Agenda, kue)
- File handles
- Background intervals
- Unflushed logs

---

## ✅ Full Production Example: Express + PostgreSQL + Bull Queue + Logger

- HTTP server
- PostgreSQL pool
- Redis queue workers (Bull)
- Log flushing

### 📁 Project Structure

^C
Received SIGINT, cleaning up...
Closing server...
PostgreSQL pool closed
Queue closed
Cleanup complete. Exiting.
```

## 🧠 Tips for Real-World Readiness

| Tip                          | Why It Matters                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| server.close() before DB.end()| Don’t kill in-flight HTTP requests    |
| Add SIGINT and SIGTERM support| Needed in Docker, Kubernetes, PM2     |
| Set timeouts (e.g., 10s max) | Avoid hanging forever                 |
| Use logger.flush()           | Prevent losing logs on shutdown       |
| Always catch unhandled errors| Add `process.on('unhandledRejection')`|

---

## ❓ Why Should We Gracefully Shutdown Instead of Just Letting the Process Crash or Exit?

If you don’t explicitly shut things down, you risk data loss, corruption, stuck resources, and zombie processes — even if the OS eventually cleans up.

---

## 🧠 What Actually Happens If You Don’t Handle Shutdown?

1. **In-flight Requests Are Dropped**
     - Requests cut off mid-response
     - Clients may retry, causing duplicates
     - Transactions may be incomplete

     **With graceful shutdown:**
     ```js
     server.close(() => {
         // no new requests accepted, existing ones finish
     });
     ```

2. **Database Connections May Leak or Stall**
     - DBs expect clients to close connections cleanly
     - If not, may wait on TCP timeout, hold locks, cause pool starvation

     **Proper `pool.end()` or `client.close()` releases connections immediately.**

3. **Message Queues / Workers May Lose Jobs**
     - In-flight jobs during crash may be lost or duplicated

     **Proper `.close()` allows the queue to finish jobs and mark them correctly.**

4. **Logs & Metrics May Be Lost**
     - Buffered logs may be lost on sudden exit

     **Calling `logger.flush()` ensures logs are written.**

5. **Zombie Processes in Docker/Kubernetes**
     - Ignoring signals can cause hung pods, CrashLoopBackOff, broken hooks

     **Handling SIGTERM correctly is production best practice.**

---

## ✅ Graceful Shutdown Prevents These Issues

| Risk if Not Handled         | Resolved By                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Dropped HTTP requests       | `server.close()`          |
| Stuck/leaking DB connections| `dbPool.end()`, `client.close()` |
| Inconsistent job processing | `queue.close()`, drain workers |
| Lost logs/traces            | `logger.flush()`          |
| Hanging Docker containers   | SIGINT/SIGTERM handling   |
| App restarts in bad state   | Clean memory, state, temp files |

---

## ✅ Summary

You cannot rely on the OS to clean everything safely.

In real production systems, graceful shutdown is not optional — it’s a requirement, especially with:

- Distributed systems
- Databases
- Queues
- Observability tooling
- Kubernetes

Understanding why Node.js streams are powerful is key to building efficient, low-memory applications that process large files, videos, or any data in chunks.

---

## 🧠 Why Streaming Is Efficient in Node.js

### Traditional Approach (Memory-Heavy)

```js
const data = fs.readFileSync('bigfile.mp4');
// Entire file is read into memory (~1GB or more)
```
- ❌ RAM is filled instantly. For large files, this leads to Out of Memory (OOM) errors.

### Streaming Approach (Memory-Efficient)

```js
const stream = fs.createReadStream('bigfile.mp4');
stream.on('data', chunk => {
    // Process 64KB (default) at a time
});
```
- ✅ Only a small chunk is held in memory at any time. Once a chunk is processed, it’s released, and the next is fetched.

---

## 🔍 How Streams Work Internally

Node.js uses the `ReadableStream` abstraction under the hood:

- **Chunked Buffering**
    - Default chunk size: 64KB for files
    - You can control it using `highWaterMark`
- **Pull-based (Paused) Mode**
    - You manually call `.read()`
    - No automatic flow of data
- **Push-based (Flowing) Mode**
    - Stream emits `'data'` events automatically
    - Memory is still limited to small chunks

---

## 🔁 Streaming Example: File to HTTP Response

```js
const http = require('http');
const fs = require('fs');

http.createServer((req, res) => {
    const readStream = fs.createReadStream('video.mp4');
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'video/mp4' });
    readStream.pipe(res);
});
```
- 🔹 This serves the video without ever loading it fully into memory.

---

## 💡 What's Happening Internally?

- `fs.createReadStream('video.mp4')` opens a file descriptor
- Reads first 64KB → emits `'data'`
- If `.pipe()` or `.on('data')` listener exists → sends to destination
- When the chunk is written, next chunk is read
- Stops when file ends or destination says "slow down" (backpressure)

---

## 🧪 Benchmark: 1GB File

| Method           | Memory Used      | Time           |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| `readFileSync()` | ~1.1 GB RAM      | Fast          |
| `createReadStream` | ~64 KB - 128 KB | Slightly slower, no memory bloat |

---

## 🔥 Backpressure: The Unsung Hero

If the destination (e.g., `res.write()`) is slower than the source (file read), Node uses backpressure:

```js
const readable = fs.createReadStream('bigfile.txt');
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('copy.txt');

readable.pipe(writable); // handles backpressure automatically
```

- If `writable.write()` returns `false`, readable is paused.
- Resumes on `'drain'` event.
- This avoids buffer overflows and high RAM usage.

---

## 📦 Bonus: Chunk Size Configuration

You can configure chunk size like this:

```js
const stream = fs.createReadStream('bigfile.txt', { highWaterMark: 1024 * 16 }); // 16KB
```

Tune `highWaterMark` based on:

- Network latency
- Disk I/O
- Memory limits



## 🚀 Deep Dive: Node.js Streams Internals

Let's explore how Node.js implements streams under the hood, step by step.

---

### 🎯 Goal

Understand how Node.js Readable Streams manage memory and data flow, and why they avoid memory bloat even with large files.

---

### 🔧 Internal Architecture of Streams

When you run:

```js
const stream = fs.createReadStream('bigfile.txt');
```

You're using a Readable stream, which is an instance of Node's internal `Readable` class from the `stream` module.

#### 1. Internal Buffer (Chunked Memory Queue)

- The stream **does not** read the entire file at once.
- It reads small chunks (default: 64KB) into an internal buffer (a FIFO queue).
- The buffer size is controlled by `highWaterMark`.

```js
fs.createReadStream('file.txt', { highWaterMark: 64 * 1024 }); // 64KB
```

> 🧠 This is called **chunked buffering**.

#### 2. Stream Modes: Paused vs Flowing

| Mode    | How It Works                                 | Triggered By                |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Paused  | You must call `.read()` to get chunks        | Default mode                |
| Flowing | Stream pushes data via `'data'` events       | When you attach `.on('data')` |

- In **flowing mode**, the stream reads from the buffer and emits `'data'` events automatically.

#### 3. Flow Control (Backpressure)

If data is being read faster than it can be written (e.g., file → network), Node.js uses **backpressure** to prevent memory bloat:

- When `.write()` returns `false`, the writable stream is full.
- The readable stream **pauses**.
- When the writable emits `'drain'`, the readable **resumes**.
- Managed internally via event listeners and a `needDrain` flag.

#### 4. State Machine Inside Readable

Node.js maintains internal state:

- `state.buffer`: Internal chunk queue
- `state.length`: Bytes currently buffered
- `state.flowing`: Whether the stream is in flowing mode
- `state.highWaterMark`: Max bytes to buffer

Example:

```js
Readable {
    _readableState: {
        buffer: [chunk1, chunk2, ...],
        length: 131072,
        flowing: true,
        highWaterMark: 65536
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ How Stream Reading Works (Step-by-Step)

1. You create a stream:

        ```js
        const stream = fs.createReadStream('big.txt');
        ```

2. Internals:
        - File descriptor opened
        - Internal buffer is empty
        - Paused mode by default

3. You attach `stream.on('data')` → switches to flowing mode

4. File read syscall happens (reads 64KB chunk)

5. Emits `'data'` event for each chunk

6. If consumer is slow → apply backpressure → pause

7. Once drained → resume

---

### 🔄 Cycle of Events (Flowing Mode)

```
[File system] --(64KB read)--> [Stream Buffer]
                                    ↓
                        'data' event
                                    ↓
                 Your .on('data', handler)
                                    ↓
         If handler slow → pause read
         When 'drain' → resume read
```

---

### 🧪 Observe Internals in Practice

Try this code to see chunking and memory usage:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

let count = 0;
const stream = fs.createReadStream('bigfile.txt', { highWaterMark: 64 * 1024 });

stream.on('data', chunk => {
    count++;
    console.log(`Chunk #${count}, Size: ${chunk.length}`);
});
```

---

### 🔍 Why Streams Are Efficient

- Never loads the entire file into memory
- Keeps memory usage small and predictable
- Handles flow with pause/resume based on consumer speed

---

### 📌 Summary Table

| Feature           | What It Means Internally                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `highWaterMark`   | Max bytes in buffer before pausing                      |
| `.read()`         | Pull data manually from buffer (paused mode)            |
| `'data'`          | Push data as soon as read (flowing mode)                |
| Backpressure      | Auto-pause if writable cannot keep up                   |
| Efficient memory  | Never buffers full file; uses small chunks (default 64KB)|

---

## ✅ When You **Don’t** Need to Manage Backpressure Manually

**Use Case:** `.pipe()`

```js
const fs = require('fs');

const readable = fs.createReadStream('large-file.txt');
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

readable.pipe(writable);
```

- `.pipe()` handles backpressure for you automatically.

**How `.pipe()` works internally:**

- Checks if `writable.write(chunk)` returns `false`
- If so, calls `readable.pause()`
- Once writable emits `'drain'`, resumes reading

> This built-in control ensures zero memory overflow.

---

## ❌ When You **Do** Need to Manage Backpressure Manually

**Use Case:** Custom streams or manual write logic

```js
readable.on('data', chunk => {
    const canWrite = writable.write(chunk);
    if (!canWrite) {
        readable.pause();
        writable.once('drain', () => readable.resume());
    }
});
```

- This is what `.pipe()` does internally.
- Only needed for custom logging, transformations, or conditional writing, or when building a custom stream handler without `.pipe()`.
























# Understanding Streams and Backpressure in Node.js

Efficient, scalable Node.js applications rely on streams and backpressure, especially when handling large data (file processing, video/audio streaming, HTTP responses, etc.).

---

## 🔁 What Are Streams?

Streams are abstract interfaces for streaming data in Node.js. Four fundamental types:

- **Readable** – Data can be read from it (e.g., `fs.createReadStream()`).
- **Writable** – Data can be written to it (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream()`).
- **Duplex** – Both readable and writable (e.g., TCP sockets).
- **Transform** – Duplex stream that can modify data (e.g., `zlib.createGzip()`).

---

## 💧 What is Backpressure?

Backpressure prevents fast producers (e.g., Readable streams) from overwhelming slow consumers (e.g., Writable streams).

**Scenario:**  
If a Readable stream pushes data faster than a Writable stream can process, memory bloat or crashes may occur.

---

## 🛠 Real-World Example: CSV File Processing with Stream and Backpressure

### 🧩 Problem

Build an API to process large CSV files, transform rows, and save to a database—without loading the entire file into memory.

### ✅ Solution

Use `fs.createReadStream()`, `csv-parser` (or `readline`), and a controlled write queue to the database.

---

### 🧪 Example: CSV to MongoDB using Streams with Backpressure

```js
const http = require('http');
const csv = require('csv-parser');
const { Writable } = require('stream');

const PORT = 3000;

http.createServer((req, res) => {
    if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/upload') {
        let activeWrites = 0;
        const MAX_CONCURRENCY = 5;
        let paused = false;

        const insertToDB = (data) => {
            return new Promise(resolve => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    console.log('Inserted:', data);
                    resolve();
                }, 200); // Simulate slow DB
            });
        };

        const writable = new Writable({
            objectMode: true,
            async write(row, _, callback) {
                activeWrites++;

                if (activeWrites >= MAX_CONCURRENCY && !paused) {
                    req.pause(); // Apply backpressure
                    paused = true;
                }

                try {
                    await insertToDB(row);
                } catch (err) {
                    console.error('DB Error:', err);
                } finally {
                    activeWrites--;

                    if (paused && activeWrites < MAX_CONCURRENCY) {
                        req.resume(); // Release backpressure
                        paused = false;
                    }

                    callback();
                }
            }
        });

        req
            .pipe(csv())
            .pipe(writable)
            .on('finish', () => {
                res.writeHead(200);
                res.end('Upload complete\n');
            })
            .on('error', (err) => {
                console.error('Pipeline error:', err);
                res.writeHead(500);
                res.end('Internal Server Error\n');
            });
    } else {
        res.writeHead(404);
        res.end('Not Found');
    }
}).listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

When hundreds of users upload large (e.g., 100MB) CSV files simultaneously, you must manage system resources—memory, CPU, file I/O, and database throughput—for stability, scalability, and performance.

---

## 🧠 Core Challenges

| Challenge                        | Example Impact                         |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Memory bloat                     | Multiple files buffered in RAM         |
| CPU saturation                   | Non-streamed CSV parsing               |
| Disk I/O bottlenecks             | Writing/reading temp files             |
| Database pressure                | Many concurrent inserts                |
| Node.js event loop blockage      | Synchronous or poorly managed code     |
| Limited single-process parallelism| Node.js is single-threaded per process |

---

## 🏢 Kafka for Large File Upload Processing

**Apache Kafka** is ideal for:

- High-throughput ingestion (e.g., 100s of concurrent 100MB uploads)
- Event-driven architecture
- Decoupling upload from processing
- Horizontal scaling

### ✅ Why Use Kafka?

| Benefit                | How it Helps Here                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Decouples upload & processing | Separate upload and CSV parsing services  |
| Handles spikes         | Kafka buffers during traffic spikes                |
| High throughput        | Millions of events per second                      |
| Horizontal scaling     | Multiple consumers process in parallel             |
| At-least-once delivery | Ensures data isn’t lost                            |
| Resilient to failures  | Messages persist if processor crashes              |

---

### 🏗 Recommended Kafka-Based Architecture

```
Client (browser / API)
                |
                v
[Express Upload Service] --(streamed CSV row per message)-->
                |
                v
        [Kafka Topic: csv-rows]
                |
                v
[CSV Row Consumer Service(s)]
                |
                v
    [DB / Analytics / Storage]
```

---

## Batching & Backpressure for Kafka Producers

When uploading a 100MB CSV file with 1 million rows:

- Don’t send 1 million `produce()` calls immediately.
- Avoid overwhelming Kafka, network, and Node.js event loop.

**Goals:**

- Batch messages (e.g., 100 or 1000 rows).
- Send periodically or by count.
- Pause stream if producer is busy (backpressure).
- Resume when Kafka is ready.

---

### 🔁 High-Level Logic

```
req (Readable stream)
    └─> csv-parser (Transform stream)
                 └─> buffer rows in-memory
                                ├─ if batchSize or flushTime → send to Kafka
                                ├─ if Kafka is slow → pause req stream
                                └─ resume stream when Kafka is ready
```

---

### ✅ Full Code Example: Batching + Backpressure

```js
const express = require('express');
const csv = require('csv-parser');
const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');
const { Readable } = require('stream');

const app = express();
const kafka = new Kafka({ brokers: ['localhost:9092'] });
const producer = kafka.producer();

const BATCH_SIZE = 100;
const FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS = 1000;

await producer.connect();

app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
    const rowsBuffer = [];
    let isPaused = false;
    let flushTimer;

    const flushBatch = async () => {
        if (rowsBuffer.length === 0) return;

        const batch = rowsBuffer.splice(0, BATCH_SIZE);
        try {
            await producer.send({
                topic: 'csv-rows',
                messages: batch.map(row => ({
                    value: JSON.stringify(row),
                })),
            });

            if (isPaused) {
                req.resume();
                isPaused = false;
            }
        } catch (err) {
            console.error('Kafka produce error:', err);
            res.status(500).send('Kafka error');
        }
    };

    const startFlushTimer = () => {
        flushTimer = setInterval(flushBatch, FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS);
    };

    req
        .pipe(csv())
        .on('data', (row) => {
            rowsBuffer.push(row);

            if (rowsBuffer.length >= BATCH_SIZE) {
                if (!isPaused) {
                    req.pause();
                    isPaused = true;
                }
                flushBatch();
            }
        })
        .on('end', async () => {
            clearInterval(flushTimer);
            await flushBatch();
            res.status(200).send('Upload processed');
        })
        .on('error', (err) => {
            console.error('Stream error:', err);
            res.status(500).send('Error processing upload');
        });

    startFlushTimer();
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### 🔍 What This Code Does

| Feature            | How it Works                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Batching           | Buffers up to 100 rows before sending             |
| Time-based flush   | Sends pending rows every 1 second                 |
| Backpressure       | `req.pause()` if buffer fills, `req.resume()` after send |
| Kafka resilience   | Catches producer errors, avoids stream flooding   |

---

### 🧪 Tips for Production

- Use `producer.sendBatch()` for higher throughput.
- Track/log memory usage (`process.memoryUsage()`).
- Use retry and dead-letter topics for failed rows.
- Use Kafka partitions for parallelism (key by tenant/user).

---

## 🔚 Summary

To batch and apply backpressure for streamed CSV upload to Kafka:

- Buffer rows until a threshold (count or timeout).
- Flush in batches.
- Pause the upload stream if buffer is full or Kafka lags.
- Resume only when safe to continue.


## `Promise.race()`: First-Wins Logic

`Promise.race()` is useful when you want to perform "first-wins" logic — meaning you only care about the first promise that settles (whether it resolves or rejects), and want to ignore the rest.

---

### ✅ Syntax

```js
Promise.race([promise1, promise2, promise3])
```
Returns a new promise that settles as soon as the first input promise settles (either fulfilled or rejected).

---

### 🔥 Real-World Use Cases of `Promise.race()`

#### 1. Timeout for Slow API Requests

You don’t want your app to wait forever for an API. Race it against a timeout!

```js
const fetchWithTimeout = (url, timeout = 3000) => {
    const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) =>
        setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout!")), timeout)
    );

    return Promise.race([
        fetch(url),
        timeoutPromise
    ]);
};

fetchWithTimeout('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error);
```

---

#### 2. Load First-Responding Mirror Server

You have 3 identical servers. Return data from the fastest one:

```js
const mirrors = [
    fetch('https://server1.example.com/data'),
    fetch('https://server2.example.com/data'),
    fetch('https://server3.example.com/data')
];

Promise.race(mirrors)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error);
```

## `Promise.any()`

Use `Promise.any()` when you want the **first successfully resolved promise** — and you don't care if some others fail.

### ✅ Syntax

```js
Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3])
```

- **Resolves** with the value of the first fulfilled promise.
- **Rejects** only if *all* promises reject (with an `AggregateError`).

---

### 🔥 Real-World Use Cases

#### 1. First Success from Redundant Services

Query multiple mirror servers or CDN endpoints — return the first success:

```js
const sources = [
    fetch("https://cdn1.example.com/resource"),
    fetch("https://cdn2.example.com/resource"),
    fetch("https://cdn3.example.com/resource")
];

Promise.any(sources)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(console.log)
    .catch(err => console.error("All sources failed:", err));
```

#### 2. Search Multiple Providers (e.g., Autocomplete)

Query multiple 3rd-party APIs for the fastest working one.

```js
Promise.any([
    fetchGoogleSuggestions(),
    fetchBingSuggestions(),
    fetchDuckDuckGoSuggestions()
])
    .then(showSuggestions)
    .catch(() => showError("No search service available."));
```

#### 3. Faster Image/Video Load

Try loading from multiple locations or formats — whichever works first:

```js
Promise.any([
    loadImage("image.webp"),
    loadImage("image.jpg"),
    loadImage("image.png")
])
    .then(showImage)
    .catch(() => showFallbackImage());
```

---

## `Promise.allSettled()`

Use `Promise.allSettled()` when you want **all promises to complete**, regardless of success or failure, and then inspect the outcome of each one.

### ✅ Syntax

```js
Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3])
```

- Returns a promise that resolves after all input promises settle.
- The result is an array of objects:
    - `{ status: "fulfilled", value: ... }`
    - `{ status: "rejected", reason: ... }`

---

### 📦 Example

```js
const promises = [
    Promise.resolve("✅ Success"),
    Promise.reject("❌ Error"),
    new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res("✅ Delayed Success"), 1000))
];

Promise.allSettled(promises).then(results => {
    results.forEach((result, index) => {
        if (result.status === "fulfilled") {
            console.log(`Promise ${index} succeeded with`, result.value);
        } else {
            console.log(`Promise ${index} failed with`, result.reason);
        }
    });
});
```

---

### 🚀 Real-World Use Cases

#### 1. Show Partial Results (e.g., dashboard widgets)

Fetch data for multiple widgets. Show what succeeded, report what failed:

```js
const widgetPromises = [
    fetch("/api/sales"),
    fetch("/api/users"),
    fetch("/api/analytics")
];

Promise.allSettled(widgetPromises).then(responses => {
    responses.forEach((res, i) => {
        if (res.status === "fulfilled") {
            renderWidget(i, res.value);
        } else {
            showWidgetError(i, res.reason);
        }
    });
});
```

#### 2. Retry Logic for Failed APIs

Collect all failures and retry only the failed ones:

```js
Promise.allSettled([
    fetch("/api/one"),
    fetch("/api/two"),
    fetch("/api/three")
])
    .then(results => {
        const failed = results
            .map((res, i) => ({ ...res, index: i }))
            .filter(res => res.status === "rejected");

        failed.forEach(({ index }) => {
            console.log(`Retrying API ${index}`);
            // retryFetch(index)...
        });
    });
```


# The Reactor Pattern: Universal Concurrency Design

The Reactor pattern is a general concurrency design, not something native or unique to Node.js. At its core, the Reactor lets you demultiplex many I/O events onto a single (or small pool of) thread(s) by:

1. **Registering** interest in events (e.g. "tell me when socket X is readable").
2. **Waiting** for the OS to signal one or more events (via epoll/kqueue/select).
3. **Dispatching** each event to its associated handler callback.
4. **Looping** back to step 2.

## Where You See Reactor Everywhere

| Technology | Key Library/Module | Language | Role of Reactor |
|------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Node.js** | libuv | C | Schedules timers, network and file I/O phases |
| **NGINX** | Built-in event loop | C | Manages thousands of HTTP/TCP connections |
| **Redis** | ae (async events) | C | Handles command parsing, client sockets, timers |
| **Browsers** | JS Event Loop | C++ / JS | Processes UI events, XHR/Fetch, Promises |
| **Python** | asyncio / Twisted | Python/C | Runs coroutines and network I/O in one thread |
| **Java** | NIO Selectors / Netty | Java | High-performance non-blocking network servers |
| **Rust** | Tokio | Rust | Async runtime for HTTP (Hyper), TCP, etc. |
| **C/C++** | libevent / libev | C | Foundation for many custom servers (e.g. HAProxy) |

## Why It's So Popular

- **Efficiency**: Avoids one-thread-per-connection overhead.
- **Simplicity**: Centralizes I/O handling logic into a single loop.
- **Scalability**: Easily extends to thousands—or even millions—of concurrent connections.

## Simple Analogy

Think of a busy help desk with **one** dispatcher (the event loop).

- Incoming calls (I/O events) hit a central switchboard.
- The dispatcher routes each call to the right specialist (handler).
- When the call is done, the dispatcher is ready for the next one.

Versus "one specialist per caller" (one thread per connection), which quickly overwhelms you when calls spike.
