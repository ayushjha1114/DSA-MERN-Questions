## ✅ 1. What is GraphQL and How Is It Different from REST?

### 🔷 What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data.  
It allows clients to specify exactly what data they need, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.  
GraphQL was developed by Facebook and released publicly in 2015.

---

### 🔷 REST vs GraphQL: Core Differences

| Feature         | REST                                         | GraphQL                                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Data Fetching   | Multiple endpoints (`/users`, `/users/1/posts`) | Single endpoint (`/graphql`)                    |
| Over-fetching   | Common (fixed structure of response)         | Avoided (request exactly what is needed)         |
| Versioning      | Requires versioned URLs (`v1`, `v2`)         | No versioning; schema evolves                   |
| Nested Data     | Requires multiple calls                      | One query can fetch deeply nested resources     |
| Tools           | Swagger, Postman                             | GraphQL Playground, Apollo DevTools             |
| Response Size   | Larger if unused fields are returned         | Smaller if fields are requested selectively     |

---

### 🔶 Real-World Example

Suppose your frontend needs a user’s name and their last 3 posts.

**REST Approach:**
```http
GET /users/123
GET /users/123/posts
```
You get full user details and all posts, even if you need only a few.

**GraphQL Approach:**
```graphql
query {
    user(id: "123") {
        name
        posts(limit: 3) {
            title
            createdAt
        }
    }
}
```
➡️ One call, just the data you want.

---

### 🔶 Why Companies Prefer GraphQL

- Great for mobile apps (limit bandwidth)
- Faster development: backend evolves independently
- Improved developer experience with introspection and auto-docs


# ✅ How Did Facebook Design GraphQL Internally?

Facebook created GraphQL in 2012 to solve a major problem:  
Their mobile apps were making multiple REST API calls, often overfetching or underfetching data.

**They needed:**
- One round-trip to fetch all relevant nested data
- A strongly typed query language
- A client-driven data model, not a server-controlled one

---

## ⚙️ How GraphQL Works Internally (Transport + Execution)

### 🔹 Step 1: GraphQL Runs Over HTTP by Default

Most GraphQL APIs (including Facebook’s) use HTTP/HTTPS:

```http
POST /graphql
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request body:**
```json
{
    "query": "query { user(id: \"1\") { name } }",
    "variables": {}
}
```

- The client sends a single POST request with the query (or mutation).
- This is the most common transport layer—HTTP/HTTPS, like REST—not WebSockets.

---

### 🔹 Step 2: WebSockets for Real-Time Use Cases (Subscriptions)

- Queries and mutations use HTTP.
- Subscriptions use WebSockets for real-time updates.

**Example:**
```graphql
subscription {
    newMessage {
        content
        sender
    }
}
```

- The server sets up a persistent WebSocket connection.
- The client receives pushed updates when data changes (e.g., new message or post).
- Facebook Messenger and Instagram Live likely use GraphQL subscriptions over WebSocket for real-time updates.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: How GraphQL Internally Resolves Data

At runtime:
1. Client sends query via HTTP or WebSocket.
2. GraphQL server:
        - Parses the query
        - Validates it against the schema
        - Executes it by calling resolver functions

**Resolvers may call:**
- SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra)
- REST APIs (microservices)
- Graph APIs (e.g., internal social graph)

The final response is merged and returned to the client.

---

## 🧠 Real Internal Example (Facebook Style)

Suppose the Facebook mobile app queries:

```graphql
query {
    me {
        name
        friends(first: 5) {
            name
            mutualFriendsCount
        }
    }
}
```

**What happens:**
- `me` resolver gets the current user ID from the token.
- `friends` resolver might query a distributed graph DB.
- `mutualFriendsCount` might hit a service that computes graph intersections.
- All of this is composed into a single JSON response.

> Even though the query feels unified, under the hood:
> - It may hit 5–10 microservices.
> - The GraphQL engine orchestrates them and returns one clean result.

---

## 📡 Protocols Used

| Use Case                        | Transport                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Queries                         | HTTP/HTTPS (POST or GET for persisted queries) |
| Mutations                       | HTTP/HTTPS                                     |
| Subscriptions                   | WebSocket                                      |
| Persisted Queries (CDN caching) | GET with hashed query in URL                   |
| Federated Gateways              | HTTP with subgraph routing                     |



## ✅ 2. Queries vs. Mutations vs. Subscriptions

GraphQL has three primary operation types, each serving a distinct purpose:

### 🔹 1. Query (Read)
- **Purpose:** Fetch data from the server (equivalent to `GET` in REST).
- **Example:**
    ```graphql
    query {
        user(id: "101") {
            name
            email
        }
    }
    ```
- **Real-World Use Cases:**
    - Fetching a logged-in user’s dashboard
    - Getting a list of products on an e-commerce home page
- **Characteristics:**
    - Read-only
    - No side effects
    - Can request nested or related data in one call

---

### 🔹 2. Mutation (Write)
- **Purpose:** Create, update, or delete data (equivalent to `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` in REST).
- **Example:**
    ```graphql
    mutation {
        createUser(input: {
            name: "Alice",
            email: "alice@example.com"
        }) {
            id
            name
        }
    }
    ```
- **Real-World Use Cases:**
    - Registering a new user
    - Liking a post
    - Updating a profile picture
- **Characteristics:**
    - Triggers changes in the backend
    - Can return updated state or objects
    - Often used with input types (`input {}`)

---

### 🔹 3. Subscription (Real-Time Updates)
- **Purpose:** Listen for real-time changes from the server (runs over WebSocket).
- **Example:**
    ```graphql
    subscription {
        newMessage(chatRoomId: "123") {
            id
            content
            sender {
                name
            }
        }
    }
    ```
- **Real-World Use Cases:**
    - New chat messages (Messenger, Slack)
    - New comments or likes in real time (Instagram, Facebook)
    - Live score updates
- **Characteristics:**
    - Persistent connection via WebSocket
    - Server pushes data to the client when triggered
    - Requires both backend and client setup for WebSocket

---

## ✅ GraphQL as a Facade Over REST or Other APIs

When you make a GraphQL query from the client:

```graphql
query {
    me {
        name
        friends {
            name
        }
    }
}
```

> The GraphQL server does **not** magically talk to the database.  
> Instead, it executes resolver functions, which might internally call:
> - REST APIs ✅
> - Databases ✅
> - Microservices ✅
> - Other GraphQL APIs ✅

**Example: GraphQL Resolvers Calling REST APIs**
```js
const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        me: async () => {
            // GraphQL server acting like a proxy to REST
            return fetch('https://api.company.com/v1/user/123').then(res => res.json());
        }
    },
    Me: {
        friends: async (parent) => {
            return fetch(`https://api.company.com/v1/user/${parent.id}/friends`).then(res => res.json());
        }
    }
}
```
GraphQL acts as an **orchestrator layer**, wrapping and aggregating multiple REST API calls internally.

---

## 📦 Why Use GraphQL on Top of REST?

If REST APIs already exist and GraphQL just wraps them, why bother?  
Here’s why many companies (like Facebook, GitHub, Shopify) use GraphQL over existing REST:

| Benefit                                 | Explanation                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔁 Single round trip                     | Instead of multiple REST calls from frontend, GraphQL makes 1 call          |
| 🎯 Precise fields                        | Avoid over/underfetching; clients ask for exactly what they need            |
| 📚 Typed schema                          | Strongly typed interface; great for documentation, introspection, tooling   |
| 🧠 Orchestration logic stays on server    | Clients don’t need to know which REST endpoint to hit or in what order      |
| 🧪 Mocking, versioning, and caching easier| You can mock resolvers or use persisted queries more easily than REST       |
| 🧱 Future flexibility                    | You can replace REST with DB/microservice later — client doesn’t change     |

---

## 🏢 Real-World Use Case at Companies Like Facebook

- GraphQL resolvers may call legacy REST APIs.
- They use internal service calls (Thrift/gRPC).
- Eventually, they might hit distributed graph databases, but the GraphQL client never knows.

> GraphQL is often just a better facade over an existing service ecosystem.

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

- GraphQL often calls REST (or other services) behind the scenes.
- **But:**  
    It centralizes and simplifies data-fetching logic for clients, especially when multiple services are involved.




## ✅ 3. What Are Schema, Types, and Resolvers in GraphQL?

This is the heart of every GraphQL server.

---

### 🧠 Conceptual Overview

| Term      | What it is                                         | Analogy                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Schema**    | Blueprint of all available data and operations      | API contract (like Swagger)    |
| **Types**     | Data structures that define shape of entities      | Classes or models              |
| **Resolvers** | Functions that resolve the values for each field   | Controller/Service functions   |

---

### 🔧 Let’s Break It Down

#### 🔷 1. GraphQL Schema

Defines what clients are allowed to ask.  
Written in **Schema Definition Language (SDL)**.

```graphql
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    email: String!
    friends: [User!]!
}

type Query {
    me: User
}
```

- `me` returns a `User`
- A `User` has `id`, `name`, `email`, and `friends` (a list of more Users)

---

#### 🔷 2. Types

GraphQL types define the structure and relationships of your data.

- **Scalar:** `String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `ID`
- **Object:** custom data like `User`, `Post`, `Comment`
- **Input:** used for sending data in mutations
- **Enum:** limited allowed values

**Example:**

```graphql
enum Role {
    ADMIN
    USER
    GUEST
}

input NewUserInput {
    name: String!
    email: String!
}
```

---

#### 🔷 3. Resolvers

Resolvers are functions that fetch the actual data when a query is run.

**Example:**

```js
const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        me: (_, __, context) => {
            return getUserFromToken(context.token); // fetch from DB or REST
        }
    },
    User: {
        friends: (user) => {
            return fetchFriends(user.id); // REST API, DB, etc.
        }
    }
};
```

Each field in the schema can have a resolver that tells GraphQL how to get the data.

---

### 💡 Flow Diagram

```
Client → GraphQL Query → Server
                         ↓
                    Schema (what’s allowed)
                         ↓
             Resolvers (how to get it)
                         ↓
                DB / REST / Microservices
```

---

### 📦 Real-World Example: Social Media App

Let's say you're building a social media dashboard:

#### 🧾 Schema (SDL):

```graphql
type Post {
    id: ID!
    content: String!
    author: User!
    likes: Int!
}

type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    posts: [Post!]!
}

type Query {
    feed: [Post!]!
}
```

#### ⚙️ Resolvers:

```js
const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        feed: () => fetch('https://api.example.com/posts').then(res => res.json())
    },
    Post: {
        author: (post) => fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${post.userId}`).then(res => res.json())
    },
    User: {
        posts: (user) => fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${user.id}/posts`).then(res => res.json())
    }
}
```

---

### 🎯 Why This Matters

Understanding schema and resolvers is key to:

- Designing flexible, scalable APIs
- Creating reusable components in frontend (React/Apollo)
- Avoiding performance bottlenecks and over-fetching
- Mapping to different backend data sources (SQL, NoSQL, REST, etc.)

## ✅ 4. GraphQL in React: How to Query and Mutate Using Apollo Client

Apollo Client is the most popular GraphQL client for React. It lets you fetch, cache, and update GraphQL data easily—while keeping your UI in sync.

---

### 🧱 Basic Setup: Installing Apollo Client

First, install the necessary libraries:

```bash
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

Then, configure Apollo in your app root:

```tsx
// src/main.jsx or App.tsx
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'https://your-api.com/graphql', // your GraphQL endpoint
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

<ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
</ApolloProvider>
```

---

### 🟦 1. Fetching Data with `useQuery`

Suppose your GraphQL schema has:

```graphql
type Query {
    me: User
}

type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
}
```

In React:

```tsx
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_ME = gql`
    query GetMe {
        me {
            id
            name
        }
    }
`;

function Profile() {
    const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(GET_ME);

    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;

    return <h1>Welcome, {data.me.name}!</h1>;
}
```

> ✅ Apollo handles fetching, caching, and updates the component when data arrives.

---

### 🟧 2. Updating Data with `useMutation`

Suppose your schema supports:

```graphql
type Mutation {
    updateName(name: String!): User
}
```

In React:

```tsx
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';
import { useState } from 'react';

const UPDATE_NAME = gql`
    mutation UpdateName($name: String!) {
        updateName(name: $name) {
            id
            name
        }
    }
`;

function UpdateNameForm() {
    const [updateName] = useMutation(UPDATE_NAME);
    const [name, setName] = useState('');

    const handleSubmit = () => {
        updateName({ variables: { name } });
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
            <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Update</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### 🟨 3. Advanced Features of Apollo Client

| Feature            | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cache Normalization| Apollo stores data efficiently and updates UI automatically              |
| Pagination         | Use `fetchMore`, relay-style pagination, or cursor-based strategies      |
| Refetch Queries    | Re-run queries after a mutation (e.g., after creating a comment)         |
| Fragments          | Share query parts between components                                     |
| Devtools           | Apollo Chrome devtools show queries, cache, loading states, etc.         |
| Polling            | Auto-refresh data periodically (`pollInterval`)                          |
| Error Handling     | Apollo provides full error and network error separation                  |

---

### ⚙️ Example: Combining Query + Mutation

Imagine a social app:

- Fetch current user with `useQuery`
- Let user update their status with `useMutation`
- Automatically update cache after mutation

```tsx
updateStatus({
    variables: { status: '🏖️ On vacation' },
    update(cache, { data: { updateStatus } }) {
        cache.writeQuery({
            query: GET_ME,
            data: { me: updateStatus },
        });
    }
});
```

## 6. How to Design a GraphQL Schema for a Real-World App

Designing a schema is the foundation of your GraphQL API. It defines what data clients can request and how they can interact with it.

### Step-by-Step Approach

#### 1️⃣ Identify Domain Entities and Relationships

For a blog app, you might have:

- **User**
- **Post**
- **Comment**
- **Category**
- **Tag**

#### 2️⃣ Define Types for Each Entity

```graphql
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    email: String!
    posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    content: String!
    author: User!
    comments: [Comment!]!
    categories: [Category!]
    tags: [Tag!]
}

type Comment {
    id: ID!
    content: String!
    author: User!
    post: Post!
}

type Category {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    posts: [Post!]!
}

type Tag {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    posts: [Post!]!
}
```

#### 3️⃣ Define Query and Mutation Types

```graphql
type Query {
    posts(categoryId: ID, tagId: ID, authorId: ID): [Post!]!
    post(id: ID!): Post
    users: [User!]!
    user(id: ID!): User
}

type Mutation {
    createPost(title: String!, content: String!, authorId: ID!): Post!
    updatePost(id: ID!, title: String, content: String): Post!
    deletePost(id: ID!): Boolean!
    addComment(postId: ID!, content: String!, authorId: ID!): Comment!
}
```

#### 4️⃣ Use Input Types for Complex Mutations

For cleaner APIs, use input types:

```graphql
input CreatePostInput {
    title: String!
    content: String!
    authorId: ID!
}

type Mutation {
    createPost(input: CreatePostInput!): Post!
}
```

#### 5️⃣ Add Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting

For scalability:

```graphql
type Query {
    posts(
        limit: Int = 10,
        offset: Int = 0,
        sortBy: String,
        filter: PostFilterInput
    ): [Post!]!
}

input PostFilterInput {
    authorId: ID
    categoryId: ID
    tagId: ID
    search: String
}
```

#### 6️⃣ Add Subscriptions for Real-Time Updates

```graphql
type Subscription {
    postAdded: Post
    commentAdded(postId: ID!): Comment
}
```

#### 7️⃣ Document Your Schema with Descriptions

Helps frontend developers and tooling:

```graphql
"""
A user of the blogging platform
"""
type User {
    ...
}
```

---

**Real-world project example:**  
- Frontend fetches paginated posts with authors and categories.
- Users create, update, delete posts.
- Comments are added in real-time with subscriptions.
- Admin filters posts by tags or authors.

## 9. How Do You Handle Pagination in GraphQL? Explain Cursor-Based vs Offset-Based Pagination

Pagination is essential when dealing with large datasets to avoid sending too much data at once and to improve performance and UX.

### Offset-Based Pagination

Traditional approach using `limit` and `offset` parameters.

**Example query:**

```graphql
query {
    posts(limit: 10, offset: 20) {
        id
        title
    }
}
```

- Server skips first 20 items, returns next 10.
- Simple but can return inconsistent data if items change between requests.
- Performance degrades with large offsets (database has to skip many rows).

### Cursor-Based Pagination (Relay-Style)

Uses an opaque cursor (usually a unique ID or timestamp) instead of numeric offsets.

**Example query:**

```graphql
query {
    posts(first: 10, after: "cursor_string") {
        edges {
            node {
                id
                title
            }
            cursor
        }
        pageInfo {
            hasNextPage
            endCursor
        }
    }
}
```

- Client gets a cursor with each page and requests the next page after that cursor.

**Advantages:**

- More reliable with changing data (avoids missing or duplicate entries).
- Efficient database queries using indexed fields.
- Standardized by Relay spec, widely used.

**Implementation Tips:**

- Use cursor based on a unique, sortable field (like `createdAt` or `id`).
- Return `pageInfo` metadata for client to know if more pages exist.
- Support both forward (`first` & `after`) and backward (`last` & `before`) pagination if needed.



## 11. How do you handle authentication and authorization in GraphQL APIs?

### Authentication vs Authorization

- **Authentication:** Verifying who the user is (login, tokens, sessions).
- **Authorization:** Checking what the authenticated user is allowed to do.

### How to Implement in GraphQL

#### 1. Authentication

- Usually handled outside GraphQL (e.g., login REST endpoint) to issue a token (JWT or session cookie).
- For every GraphQL request:
    - Client sends the token in the HTTP headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
    - On the server, extract and verify the token in the context creation function.

**Example in Apollo Server:**

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema,
    context: ({ req }) => {
        const token = req.headers.authorization || '';
        const user = getUserFromToken(token); // verify and decode token
        return { user };
    }
});
```

#### 2. Authorization

- Performed inside resolvers or middleware.
- Check `context.user` and verify roles/permissions.

**Example:**

```js
const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        secretData: (parent, args, context) => {
            if (!context.user) throw new AuthenticationError("Not authenticated");
            if (!context.user.roles.includes('ADMIN')) throw new ForbiddenError("Not authorized");
            return "Sensitive admin data";
        }
    }
};
```

#### 3. Using Directives for Authorization

- Custom schema directives can be used to declaratively add authorization rules.

**Example:**

```graphql
directive @auth(role: String) on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
    adminData: String @auth(role: "ADMIN")
}
```

- Implement directive logic to check user roles before resolver execution.

## 13. What is GraphQL federation? How does it enable building a distributed GraphQL architecture?

### GraphQL Federation Explained

#### Background

- As apps grow, a single monolithic GraphQL server can become complex and hard to maintain.
- Different teams own different parts of the data graph.
- Federation lets multiple GraphQL services work together as one graph.

#### What is Federation?

- A way to compose multiple GraphQL services (called subgraphs) into a single, unified API.
- Each subgraph defines a portion of the overall schema.
- The Apollo Gateway composes these into one schema that clients query.

#### How Does It Work?

- **Subgraphs:** Each microservice owns its own GraphQL schema and data sources.
- **Schema Composition:** The Apollo Gateway combines schemas using special directives (like `@key`, `@extends`) to share and link types across subgraphs.
- **Query Planning:** The gateway breaks down client queries into subqueries sent to respective subgraphs, then combines the results.

#### Key Concepts

- `@key` directive: Identifies a primary key for a type to enable references across services.
- `@extends` directive: Allows a subgraph to extend types owned by other services.
- **Entities:** Types shared across subgraphs.

#### Benefits

- Enables modular development and team autonomy.
- Improves scalability and code ownership.
- Avoids a giant schema maintained by a single team.

#### Example

Suppose you have two teams:

- **User Service:** owns `User` type.
- **Product Service:** owns `Product` type.

**User Service schema:**

```graphql
type User @key(fields: "id") {
    id: ID!
    name: String
}
```

**Product Service schema:**

```graphql
type Product {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    seller: User @provides(fields: "id")
}
```

- Apollo Gateway stitches these into one schema clients query.

#### Real-world Usage

- Large companies like Apollo, Airbnb, and Shopify use federation to scale GraphQL APIs across teams.

## 14. How do GraphQL directives work? Can you create custom directives?

### GraphQL Directives Explained

#### What are Directives?

- Directives are annotations in your GraphQL queries or schemas that modify the execution or validation behavior.
- They start with `@` and are placed on fields, fragments, or schema definitions.

#### Built-in Directives

- `@include(if: Boolean)` — Conditionally include a field.
- `@skip(if: Boolean)` — Conditionally skip a field.
- `@deprecated(reason: String)` — Marks a field or enum value as deprecated.

**Example:**

```graphql
query getUser($withEmail: Boolean!) {
    user(id: "123") {
        name
        email @include(if: $withEmail)
    }
}
```

#### Custom Directives

- You can create your own directives to add custom logic at runtime or schema build time.

**How to Create Custom Directives**

1. Define the directive in schema:

        ```graphql
        directive @auth(role: String) on FIELD_DEFINITION
        ```

2. Implement directive logic (e.g., using Apollo Server’s schema directives or schema transforms).

**Example usage:**

```graphql
type Query {
    secretData: String @auth(role: "ADMIN")
}
```

- The directive implementation would check the user’s role from context and allow or block access.

**Use cases for custom directives:**

- Authorization and authentication
- Logging or analytics hooks
- Input validation
- Formatting or transformation of field results

## How Do You Handle Versioning in GraphQL APIs?

### Background

- Unlike REST APIs, where versioning is often done via URL (e.g., `/api/v1/users`), GraphQL encourages schema evolution without explicit versioning.
- GraphQL is designed to be backwards-compatible by adding fields and types instead of removing or changing existing ones.

### Strategies for Versioning in GraphQL

#### Evolve the Schema without Versions

- Add new fields or types as needed.
- Mark deprecated fields with the `@deprecated` directive.
- Keep old fields available until clients have migrated.

**Example:**

```graphql
type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    fullName: String @deprecated(reason: "Use `name` instead")
}
```

- This approach encourages continuous evolution rather than breaking changes.

#### Use Deprecation Warnings

- The `@deprecated` directive informs clients to stop using specific fields or types.
- Tools like GraphQL Playground or Apollo Studio show deprecated warnings, helping frontend teams migrate.

#### Schema Stitching / Gateway

- If you run multiple services, you can evolve schemas separately.
- The GraphQL gateway can expose a unified schema that can maintain backward compatibility.

#### Custom Version Fields (Rare)

- Some APIs expose a version field or enum inside the schema to signal different behaviors.
- However, this is uncommon and generally discouraged because it complicates the schema.

#### Separate Endpoints (Not Recommended)

- Serving multiple GraphQL endpoints for different versions (`/graphql/v1`, `/graphql/v2`) is possible but goes against GraphQL best practices.
- It can increase maintenance overhead and reduce flexibility.

### Best Practices

- Favor additive changes: Add new types and fields without removing old ones immediately.
- Deprecate fields properly and communicate clearly to clients.
- Coordinate client and server deployments for smooth transitions.
- Use schema validation and CI to prevent breaking changes accidentally.
- Consider using tools like Apollo Studio for schema change tracking and monitoring usage of deprecated fields.

## How Do You Handle Real-Time Updates in GraphQL?

Real-time updates are crucial in modern apps (e.g., chat apps, live feeds). GraphQL supports this primarily via **Subscriptions**, but there are other approaches too.

### 1. GraphQL Subscriptions

- Subscriptions allow clients to listen to real-time data pushed from the server.
- Typically implemented over WebSockets, providing a persistent connection.
- When an event happens (e.g., new message), the server pushes updated data to subscribed clients.

**How it works:**

1. Client opens a WebSocket connection to the GraphQL server.
2. Client sends a subscription query over this connection.
3. Server maintains the subscription and watches for relevant events.
4. When an event triggers, server sends data through WebSocket to the client.
5. Client updates UI accordingly.

**Example schema subscription:**

```graphql
type Subscription {
    messageAdded(channelId: ID!): Message
}
```

**Client subscribes like:**

```graphql
subscription OnMessageAdded($channelId: ID!) {
    messageAdded(channelId: $channelId) {
        id
        content
        user {
            username
        }
    }
}
```

**Popular libraries:**

- Apollo Server and Client support subscriptions.
- `graphql-ws` and `subscriptions-transport-ws` are popular WebSocket protocols.

### 2. Polling

- Client periodically sends queries at fixed intervals to check for updates.
- Easier to implement but less efficient and can increase server load.
- Good fallback if WebSocket support is limited.

**Example:**

```js
useQuery(GET_MESSAGES, {
    pollInterval: 5000, // fetch every 5 seconds
});
```

### 3. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

- An alternative to WebSockets.
- Server pushes updates over HTTP.
- Less complex but less widely used with GraphQL.




# 🧠 What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs, developed by Facebook. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need—no more, no less.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Declarative data fetching:** Ask for the shape of data you need.
- **Single endpoint:** Unlike REST, GraphQL uses one endpoint.
- **Strongly typed schema:** The API structure is defined with a schema.
- **No over-fetching or under-fetching:** Only the requested data is returned.

---

## 📦 Setup Overview

### 1. Backend: Node.js + Express + Apollo Server

This is the most common setup.

#### a. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install express apollo-server-express graphql
```

#### b. Create a basic server

```js
// index.js
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-express');

const typeDefs = gql`
    type Query {
        hello: String
    }
`;

const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        hello: () => 'Hello world!',
    },
};

async function startServer() {
    const app = express();
    const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

    await server.start();
    server.applyMiddleware({ app });

    app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>
        console.log(`Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`)
    );
}

startServer();
```

---

### 2. Frontend: React.js + Apollo Client

#### a. Install Apollo Client

```bash
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

#### b. Setup ApolloProvider

```jsx
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';
import App from './App';

const client = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

ReactDOM.render(
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
        <App />
    </ApolloProvider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

#### c. Query Data in a Component

```jsx
// App.js
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const HELLO_QUERY = gql`
    query {
        hello
    }
`;

function App() {
    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(HELLO_QUERY);

    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error!</p>;

    return <h1>{data.hello}</h1>;
}

export default App;
```

---

## 🔄 Development Flow

1. **Define schema** on the server (`typeDefs`).
2. **Write resolvers** to fetch data from DB or services.
3. **Use Apollo Client** on React to query/mutate data.


# 🏗️ Step 1: Project Structure

```
graphql-blog/
├── server/          # Node.js + Apollo + Mongoose
└── client/          # React + Apollo Client
```

# 🔧 Step 2: Set Up the Backend

## 1. Initialize the Node.js Project

```bash
mkdir graphql-blog && cd graphql-blog
mkdir server && cd server
npm init -y
npm install express apollo-server-express graphql mongoose dotenv
```

## 2. Create a MongoDB Connection

**server/db.js**
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connectDB = async () => {
    try {
        await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useUnifiedTopology: true
        });
        console.log('MongoDB connected');
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err.message);
        process.exit(1);
    }
};

module.exports = connectDB;
```

**Create `.env`:**
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/graphql_blog
```

## 3. Define Mongoose Models

**server/models/User.js**
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    username: String,
    email: String
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
```

**server/models/Post.js**
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const PostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: String,
    content: String,
    author: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'User'
    }
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Post', PostSchema);
```

## 4. Define GraphQL Schema & Resolvers

**server/schema.js**
```js
const { gql } = require('apollo-server-express');
const User = require('./models/User');
const Post = require('./models/Post');

const typeDefs = gql`
    type User {
        id: ID!
        username: String!
        email: String!
        posts: [Post]
    }

    type Post {
        id: ID!
        title: String!
        content: String!
        author: User
    }

    type Query {
        users: [User]
        posts: [Post]
        post(id: ID!): Post
    }

    type Mutation {
        createUser(username: String!, email: String!): User
        createPost(title: String!, content: String!, authorId: ID!): Post
    }
`;

const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        users: () => User.find(),
        posts: () => Post.find().populate('author'),
        post: (_, { id }) => Post.findById(id).populate('author')
    },
    Mutation: {
        createUser: (_, { username, email }) =>
            User.create({ username, email }),
        createPost: (_, { title, content, authorId }) =>
            Post.create({ title, content, author: authorId })
    },
    User: {
        posts: (parent) => Post.find({ author: parent.id })
    }
};

module.exports = { typeDefs, resolvers };
```

## 5. Apollo Server Setup

**server/index.js**
```js
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server-express');
const connectDB = require('./db');
const { typeDefs, resolvers } = require('./schema');

async function startServer() {
    const app = express();
    await connectDB();

    const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
    await server.start();
    server.applyMiddleware({ app });

    app.listen({ port: 4000 }, () =>
        console.log(`Server ready at http://localhost:4000${server.graphqlPath}`)
    );
}

startServer();
```

---

## ✅ At This Point

You can run:

```bash
node index.js
```

Then open [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) to test your API with queries like:

```graphql
mutation {
    createUser(username: "john", email: "john@example.com") {
        id
        username
    }
}
```

## ⚛️ Step 3: React + Apollo Client Setup

### 1. Create the React App

From the root `graphql-blog` folder, run:

```bash
npx create-react-app client
cd client
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

### 2. Set Up Apollo Client

Edit `client/src/index.js`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import {
    ApolloClient,
    InMemoryCache,
    ApolloProvider
} from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
        <App />
    </ApolloProvider>
);
```

---

## ✏️ Step 4: Query Posts and Users

Edit `client/src/App.js`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_POSTS = gql`
    query {
        posts {
            id
            title
            content
            author {
                username
            }
        }
    }
`;

function App() {
    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_POSTS);

    if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error fetching posts</p>;

    return (
        <div style={{ padding: '1rem' }}>
            <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
            {data.posts.map(post => (
                <div key={post.id} style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
                    <h2>{post.title}</h2>
                    <p>{post.content}</p>
                    <small>By: {post.author?.username}</small>
                </div>
            ))}
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

---

## ➕ Step 5: Add Mutation to Create Posts

### Create Post Form Component

Create `client/src/CreatePost.js`:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useMutation, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const CREATE_POST = gql`
    mutation CreatePost($title: String!, $content: String!, $authorId: ID!) {
        createPost(title: $title, content: $content, authorId: $authorId) {
            id
            title
        }
    }
`;

function CreatePost({ authorId }) {
    const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
    const [content, setContent] = useState('');
    const [createPost, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(CREATE_POST);

    const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        await createPost({ variables: { title, content, authorId } });
        setTitle('');
        setContent('');
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} style={{ marginTop: '2rem' }}>
            <h3>Create a Post</h3>
            <input
                type="text"
                placeholder="Title"
                value={title}
                onChange={e => setTitle(e.target.value)}
            /><br />
            <textarea
                placeholder="Content"
                value={content}
                onChange={e => setContent(e.target.value)}
            /><br />
            <button type="submit" disabled={loading}>Submit</button>
            {error && <p>Error: {error.message}</p>}
        </form>
    );
}

export default CreatePost;
```

### Update App.js to Use It

Below the list of posts, import and use the `CreatePost` component:

```jsx
import CreatePost from './CreatePost';

// hardcoded authorId (replace with actual user ID from DB)
<CreatePost authorId="PUT_A_VALID_USER_ID_HERE" />
```
