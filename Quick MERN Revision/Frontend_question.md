# 🔁 What is `useMemo`?

```jsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

`useMemo` caches the result of a computation (`computeExpensiveValue`) until its dependencies (`[a, b]`) change. This prevents unnecessary recalculations and optimizes performance.

---

## ⚙️ How `useMemo` Works Under the Hood

1. **Component Fiber Stores Hook State**
    - React tracks hooks using the Fiber tree.
    - Each component’s fiber node stores an array of hooks, including the result of `useMemo`.

2. **During Initial Render**
    - React runs the `useMemo` hook.
    - Executes the function (e.g., `computeExpensiveValue()`).
    - Stores the returned value and the dependencies array `[a, b]`.

3. **On Re-render**
    - React compares the new dependencies with the previous dependencies:
      - **If they’re equal (shallow comparison):** React reuses the cached value.
      - **If they’re not equal:** React recalculates the function and updates the stored value.

---

## 📌 Where is it Stored?

- The memoized value lives in memory (RAM).
- It’s stored in React’s internal hook state, not in browser storage (e.g., `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `IndexedDB`).
- It exists only for the lifecycle of the component in the current session.

---

## 🧠 Visual Mental Model

```
Component Fiber
 └── hooks[]
          ├── useState
          ├── useEffect
          └── useMemo
                     ├── dependencies: [a, b]
                     └── value: cachedResult
```

React keeps track of this state during each render cycle, using an internal pointer (`hookIndex`) to know which hook is which.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

| Myth                              | Truth                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `useMemo` stores in browser cache  | ❌ No, only in component memory                                       |
| `useMemo` avoids all re-renders    | ❌ No, only avoids recomputing logic                                  |
| `useMemo` is like Redux or Context | ❌ No, it does not persist across unmounts                            |

---

## 🧠 When to Use `useMemo`

✅ Use it when:
- You’re running an expensive calculation (e.g., sorting, filtering, heavy loops).
- That calculation depends on props/state that don’t change often.
- You want to prevent unnecessary work, especially in render loops.

---

## 🚀 Bonus: Why Not `localStorage`?

- `localStorage` and others persist across sessions.
- `useMemo` is ephemeral—optimized only for within-the-same-render-cycle.
- Storing things in browser storage requires manual serialization, and access times are slower than in-memory cache.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Example: Combining `useRef`, `forwardRef`, and `useImperativeHandle`

Here's a practical scenario that demonstrates how to:

- **`useRef`** – Hold a reference in a parent component.
- **`forwardRef`** – Forward that reference to a child.
- **`useImperativeHandle`** – Expose specific methods or values from the child to the parent.

### 💡 Scenario: Custom Input with Focus and Clear Methods

Suppose you have a form where the parent component needs to:

- Programmatically **focus** the input.
- **Clear** the input value.
- **Get** the current input value.

---

### 📄 `CustomInput.js` – Child Component

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useImperativeHandle, forwardRef, useState } from 'react';

const CustomInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const inputRef = useRef();
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
     focusInput: () => {
        inputRef.current.focus();
     },
     clearInput: () => {
        setValue('');
        inputRef.current.value = '';
     },
     getValue: () => inputRef.current.value,
  }));

  return (
     <input
        ref={inputRef}
        value={value}
        onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Type something..."
     />
  );
});

export default CustomInput;
```

---

### 📄 `App.js` – Parent Component

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import CustomInput from './CustomInput';

export default function App() {
  const customInputRef = useRef();

  const handleFocus = () => {
     customInputRef.current.focusInput();
  };

  const handleClear = () => {
     customInputRef.current.clearInput();
  };

  const handleGetValue = () => {
     alert('Input value: ' + customInputRef.current.getValue());
  };

  return (
     <div style={{ padding: '20px' }}>
        <h2>Custom Input with Imperative Handle</h2>
        <CustomInput ref={customInputRef} />
        <br /><br />
        <button onClick={handleFocus}>Focus Input</button>
        <button onClick={handleClear}>Clear Input</button>
        <button onClick={handleGetValue}>Get Input Value</button>
     </div>
  );
}
```

---

### 📝 Key Takeaways

- **`useRef`** in the parent holds a reference to the child.
- **`forwardRef`** allows the parent to pass its ref to the child.
- **`useImperativeHandle`** lets the child expose imperative methods (`focusInput`, `clearInput`, `getValue`) to the parent.
- This pattern is useful for building reusable components that need to expose custom methods to their parents.

## 🔁 Related Hooks: `useTransition` & `useDeferredValue`

### 1. `useTransition`

- **Purpose:** Mark some state updates as non-urgent, so React can interrupt them and prioritize more urgent updates (like typing or clicking).
- **Syntax:**
  ```jsx
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  ```
- **Example:**
  ```jsx
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleChange = (e) => {
     const value = e.target.value;
     setInput(value);

     startTransition(() => {
        const filtered = bigList.filter(item => item.includes(value));
        setResults(filtered);
     });
  };
  ```
- **When to Use:** Searching/filtering large lists, updating large UI parts on input without blocking UI.

---

### 2. `useDeferredValue`

- **Purpose:** Defer the rendering of a non-urgent value, letting more urgent updates (like typing) go first.
- **Syntax:**
  ```jsx
  const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
  ```
- **Example:**
  ```jsx
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);

  const filteredItems = bigList.filter(item =>
     item.includes(deferredQuery)
  );
  ```
- **When to Use:** Similar to `useTransition`, but used for values, not state updates. Debounces rendering effects of changing input.

---

## ⚙️ React's Rendering Model (React 18+)

### 🧠 1. Two Phases of Rendering

React breaks rendering into two distinct phases:

| Phase         | What it Does                                              |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Render Phase  | Computes what should be rendered (Virtual DOM diffing).  |
| Commit Phase  | Applies changes to the DOM (browser painting happens).   |

- In Concurrent Mode, the Render Phase is interruptible and can be paused and resumed.

---

## 🚀 What's New in React 18+

### 🧵 1. Concurrent Rendering (Time-Slicing)

- React can pause, interrupt, and resume rendering work.
- Uses a cooperative scheduling algorithm.
- Prioritizes urgent updates (e.g., typing) over non-urgent ones (e.g., big list filtering).
- Hooks like `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, and `useSyncExternalStore` are built around this.

---

## 🧠 What Happens in "Legacy Mode"?

**In pre-React 18 (legacy mode):**

- Rendering is **synchronous** and **non-interruptible**.
- Once a component starts rendering, React **blocks the main thread** until it's done.
- Long rendering tasks can **freeze the UI**, leading to poor user experience.

---

## ⚙️ How React 18’s Concurrent Mode Works (Under the Hood)

React 18 introduced a new concurrent rendering engine. Here’s how it enables pausing and resuming rendering:

### 1. Scheduling with Time Slicing

React uses a scheduling algorithm (via the `scheduler` package) to:

- **Break rendering into small units of work.**
- After each unit, **check for higher-priority tasks** (like user input).
- If needed, **pause rendering**, let the urgent task run, and **resume rendering later**.

> _This is called **cooperative multitasking**—like using `setTimeout` to break up a long task so other things can run in between._

---

### 2. Interruptible Rendering

- React’s internal renderer (**Fiber**) creates a linked list of work units called **fibers**.
- Each fiber node represents a piece of the UI (component or DOM element).
- Fibers can be processed **individually and incrementally**.

> **Example:** Rendering a large list—React can render 20 items, pause, then resume with the 21st, etc.

---

### 3. Priority Levels

React assigns **priority lanes** to updates:

- **Immediate:** Typing, clicks
- **User-blocking**
- **Normal**
- **Low priority**
- **Idle**

If a higher-priority update arrives during a lower-priority render:

- React **suspends** the low-priority task.
- **Switches** to the urgent one.
- **Resumes** the previous work when possible.

---

### 4. No DOM Mutations Until Commit

- Rendering happens in "pieces", but **DOM is updated only during the commit phase**.
- Users **never see half-rendered UIs**.

---

## 🧩 Real World Example: Typeahead Search with `useTransition`

```jsx
const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
const [results, setResults] = useState([]);
const [startTransition, isPending] = useTransition();

const handleChange = (e) => {
    const value = e.target.value;
    setQuery(value); // urgent update
    startTransition(() => {
        // low-priority update (can be paused)
        const filtered = heavySearch(value); 
        setResults(filtered);
    });
};
```

**Explanation:**

- `setQuery(value)` is **urgent**—React updates it immediately.
- `startTransition` wraps a **slower update** (`setResults`) that React can pause/resume.

---

## 🛠️ TL;DR: How It Works Mechanically

| Step                    | What Happens                                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Break into work units   | React turns rendering into incremental steps (fibers).   |
| Check for interruptions | After each unit, React checks for more urgent work.      |
| Pause & switch tasks    | If needed, React pauses and switches to urgent tasks.    |
| Resume later            | React resumes where it left off when possible.           |
| Commit                  | DOM is updated only once all work is done.               |

### 🌐 2. Hydration in React (SSR + CSR)

- Hydration is the process of taking server-rendered HTML and attaching event listeners and internal React state to it on the client side.

**Hydration Steps:**
1. HTML is generated on the server (via `renderToString()` or `renderToPipeableStream()`).
2. Browser receives raw HTML — fast first paint.
3. React hydrates — attaches listeners, restores state and refs.
4. Client-side navigation becomes interactive.

**Improvements in React 18:**
- Selective hydration: hydrate parts of the UI on-demand.
- Streaming HTML: stream HTML progressively.
- Suspense-enabled hydration: hydrate components as their data arrives.

---

### 🎨 3. Painting and `useInsertionEffect`

React optimizes when to paint (i.e., show UI on screen) based on priority.

| Hook                | Timing                | Purpose                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `useEffect`         | After paint          | Async side effects                      |
| `useLayoutEffect`   | Before paint         | DOM read/write that affects layout      |
| `useInsertionEffect`| Even earlier         | Injecting styles (used by CSS-in-JS)    |

---

## 🏗️ How React Internally Works (Simplified Timeline)

1. Input event or state change triggered
2. React schedules an update:
    - If urgent (e.g., typing): runs ASAP
    - If non-urgent (via `startTransition`): delays
3. Virtual DOM diffing (Render Phase):
    - Can pause & resume (Concurrent Mode)
4. Reconciliation (compare old vs new Virtual DOM)
5. Commit Phase:
    - Update real DOM
    - Run layout effects (`useLayoutEffect`)
    - Trigger browser repaint
6. Browser paints changes to screen

---

## 🌊 React 18 + Server Rendering (Streaming & Suspense)

React 18 introduces `renderToPipeableStream()`:

```js
renderToPipeableStream(<App />, {
  onShellReady() {
     pipeToResponse(res);
  }
});
```

- Streams HTML to the browser in chunks
- Hydration happens as chunks arrive
- Improves time-to-interactive

**Example: Selective Hydration with Suspense**

```jsx
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <HeavyComponent />
</Suspense>
```

- Server sends static shell + spinner
- When `HeavyComponent` is ready, it’s hydrated client-side
- You don’t block rendering the entire page

---

## 🧬 React’s Internal Fiber Architecture

- React uses a Fiber tree:
  - Each element in the tree is a Fiber node
  - Keeps track of work-in-progress state
  - Enables pausing/resuming, time-slicing

```js
Fiber = {
  type: component/function,
  stateNode: actual DOM node,
  child, sibling, return: navigation pointers,
  memoizedProps, memoizedState
}
```

---

# 🌐 What are Server-Sent Events (SSE)?

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a web technology that enables servers to push real-time updates to clients over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. It's particularly useful for applications that require continuous data streams from the server to the client, such as live news feeds, stock tickers, or real-time notifications.

---

## 🔧 How SSE Works

1. **Client Initiation:** The client establishes a connection by creating an `EventSource` object pointing to a specific server endpoint.

    ```js
    const eventSource = new EventSource('/sse-endpoint');
    ```

2. **Server Response:** The server responds with a `Content-Type` of `text/event-stream` and keeps the connection open, sending data as events occur.

3. **Data Format:** Each message from the server follows a specific format:

    ```
    data: Your message here
    ```

    Multiple lines can be sent by repeating the `data:` prefix.

4. **Client Handling:** The client listens for incoming messages using event listeners:

    ```js
    eventSource.onmessage = function(event) {
      console.log('New message:', event.data);
    };
    ```

5. **Automatic Reconnection:** If the connection drops, the browser automatically attempts to reconnect after a specified interval.

---

## ✅ Advantages of SSE

- **Simplicity:** Utilizes standard HTTP protocols, making it easy to implement and compatible with existing infrastructure.
- **Efficient for Unidirectional Data:** Ideal for scenarios where data flows only from the server to the client.
- **Automatic Reconnection:** Built-in support for reconnecting in case of connection loss.
- **Lightweight:** Lower overhead compared to WebSockets, especially beneficial for applications with many clients.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations of SSE

- **Unidirectional Communication:** Only supports server-to-client data flow. For bidirectional communication, WebSockets are more appropriate.
- **Text-Only Data:** SSE supports only UTF-8 encoded text. Binary data must be encoded (e.g., Base64), which can add overhead.
- **Browser Support:** While most modern browsers support SSE, some older versions and Internet Explorer do not.
- **Connection Limits:** Browsers limit the number of concurrent SSE connections per domain (typically around 6), which can be restrictive for applications requiring multiple streams.

---

## 📊 Use Cases for SSE

- **Live News Feeds:** Pushing breaking news updates to clients in real-time.
- **Stock Market Tickers:** Streaming stock price updates as they change.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Sending alerts or messages to users instantly.
- **Monitoring Dashboards:** Updating system metrics or logs in real-time.

## 🔄 SSE vs. WebSockets

| Feature                | SSE                                 | WebSockets                        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Communication Direction| Unidirectional (Server → Client)    | Bidirectional (Server ↔ Client)   |
| Protocol               | HTTP/1.1                            | Custom WebSocket Protocol         |
| Data Format            | UTF-8 Text                          | Text and Binary                   |
| Browser Support        | Most modern browsers (except IE)    | Most modern browsers              |
| Complexity             | Simpler to implement                | More complex                      |
| Use Case Suitability   | Ideal for server-to-client updates  | Ideal for interactive applications|

---

In summary, **Server-Sent Events** provide a straightforward and efficient mechanism for real-time, server-to-client communication, especially suitable for applications that require continuous data streams without the overhead of full-duplex communication.




### 🔌 Real-World Example: WebSockets in ReactJS

**Use Case:** Building a real-time chat application where users can send and receive messages instantly.

#### Implementation Overview

**WebSocket Server:** Set up a WebSocket server using Node.js and the `ws` library.

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
    ws.on('message', (message) => {
        // Broadcast the received message to all connected clients
        wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
            if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
                client.send(message);
            }
        });
    });
});
```

**React Client:** In your React application, establish a WebSocket connection and handle incoming messages.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ChatApp = () => {
    const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
    const [input, setInput] = useState('');
    const [ws, setWs] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
        setWs(socket);

        socket.onmessage = (event) => {
            setMessages((prev) => [...prev, event.data]);
        };

        return () => {
            socket.close();
        };
    }, []);

    const sendMessage = () => {
        if (ws && input) {
            ws.send(input);
            setInput('');
        }
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <div>
                {messages.map((msg, index) => (
                    <div key={index}>{msg}</div>
                ))}
            </div>
            <input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
            <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default ChatApp;
```

**Benefits:**

- Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server.
- Ideal for applications like chat systems, live notifications, and collaborative tools.

### 📡 Real-World Example: Server-Sent Events (SSE) in ReactJS

**Use Case:** Displaying live stock prices that update in real-time without requiring user interaction.

#### Implementation Overview

**Express Server:** Create an SSE endpoint that streams stock price updates.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/stocks', (req, res) => {
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/event-stream');
    res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'no-cache');
    res.setHeader('Connection', 'keep-alive');

    const sendStockPrice = () => {
        const price = (Math.random() * 100).toFixed(2);
        res.write(`data: ${price}\n\n`);
    };

    const interval = setInterval(sendStockPrice, 1000);

    req.on('close', () => {
        clearInterval(interval);
    });
});

app.listen(8000, () => {
    console.log('SSE server running on port 8000');
});
```

**React Client:** Use the EventSource API to receive updates from the server.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const StockPrices = () => {
    const [price, setPrice] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:8000/stocks');

        eventSource.onmessage = (e) => {
            setPrice(e.data);
        };

        return () => {
            eventSource.close();
        };
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Live Stock Price: ${price}</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

export default StockPrices;
```

**Benefits:**

- Simplifies server-to-client streaming for real-time updates.
- Ideal for dashboards, live feeds, and monitoring applications.

### 🔍 Choosing Between WebSockets and SSE

| Feature         | WebSockets                        | Server-Sent Events (SSE)           |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Communication   | Bidirectional (client ↔ server)  | Unidirectional (server → client)   |
| Protocol        | Custom WebSocket protocol over TCP| Standard HTTP/1.1                  |
| Data Format     | Text and binary                  | UTF-8 text only                    |
| Browser Support | Broad support, including older browsers | Limited in some older browsers |
| Use Cases       | Chat apps, games, collaborative tools | Live feeds, notifications, dashboards |

**Recommendation:**

- Use **WebSockets** when your application requires real-time, two-way communication.
- Use **SSE** for simpler, server-to-client streaming needs.


## 1. React Core & Fundamentals

### Q. How did React work in previous versions, and how does React work in React 18?

Modern React has evolved significantly from its earlier versions to React 18, introducing features that improve responsiveness, scalability, and developer ergonomics.

---

#### **Why React Needed an Update**

- **Janky UIs:** Long renders blocked user interactions (typing, scrolling).
- **Complex external subscriptions:** Custom hooks could miss updates or produce inconsistent reads (“tearing”) under future async rendering.
- **SSR mismatches:** Server-rendered HTML might not match the initial client snapshot, causing hydration warnings or layout shifts.

React 18 rearchitected the core to address these, introducing concurrent rendering, automatic batching, and built-in solutions for subscriptions and prioritization.

---

#### **React 17 and Earlier: The Synchronous World**

- **Root API:**
    ```js
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, container);
    ```
    Every update beneath `<App />` was synchronous.

- **State Updates:**
    - Batched only inside React event handlers:
        ```js
        // In a click handler: both setState calls are batched
        onClick = () => {
            setCount(c => c + 1);
            setFlag(f => !f);
        };
        ```
    - Outside React handlers (e.g., in timeouts or promises), each `setState` triggered its own render.

- **Subscriptions to External Stores:**
    ```js
    useEffect(() => {
        subscribe(store, () => setLocal(store.get()));
        return () => unsubscribe(store);
    }, []);
    ```
    If the store changed between the render phase and the effect setup, components could miss that update.

- **No Render Priorities:** All updates had equal priority—typing in an input during a heavy list re-render could freeze until the list finished.

- **SSR & Hydration:** Server rendered HTML, client rehydrated it, and differences produced warnings but seldom broke user flows.

---

#### **React 18: The Concurrent Era**

1. **New Root API & Concurrent-Ready**
     ```js
     const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
     root.render(<App />);
     ```
     - Concurrent Mode on by default (opt-in per root).
     - React can now pause, resume, or abandon renders to keep the UI responsive.

2. **Automatic Batching Everywhere**
     - All state updates in the same tick—regardless of origin—are batched into a single render:
         ```js
         setTimeout(() => {
             setCount(c => c + 1);
             setFlag(f => !f);
             // Still just one render in React 18
         }, 0);
         ```

3. **Transitions for Prioritization**
     - `useTransition` / `startTransition`: Mark non-urgent updates so urgent ones aren’t blocked.
     - `useDeferredValue`: Let a rapidly changing value lag behind, preventing expensive downstream work on every keystroke.

4. **Safe Subscriptions: `useSyncExternalStore`**
     - Guarantees you never miss an update between render and subscribe.
     - Allows you to specify a server snapshot for SSR, eliminating hydration mismatches.

5. **Stable Unique IDs: `useId`**
     - Generates identical IDs on server and client, essential for form labels and ARIA attributes in SSR.

6. **New Insertion-Effect: `useInsertionEffect`**
     - Library hook for injecting styles (CSS-in-JS) just before layout, preventing flicker under concurrent rendering.

7. **SSR Streaming & Suspense on Server**
     - Stream HTML in chunks around `<Suspense>` boundaries.
     - Selective hydration: hydrate interactive widgets first, then the rest.

8. **Stricter Dev-Only Checks**
     - Double-mount in Strict Mode surfaces unsafe side effects.
     - Hydration mismatches become errors, not just warnings.

| Feature                | React 17 & Earlier         | React 18                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Root API               | ReactDOM.render           | createRoot + root.render                 |

| Strict Mode            | Mount once                | Double invoke to test side effects       |

---

#### **What This Means for You as a Lead**

- Adopt the new root API in all new projects; gradually migrate existing ones.
- Leverage automatic batching to simplify performance optimizations.
- Architect UIs with transitions: designate heavy updates as non-urgent to preserve interactivity.
- Standardize subscriptions on `useSyncExternalStore` for any global state, event emitter, or browser API.
- Plan SSR with Suspense streaming to deliver faster First Contentful Paint and Time to Interactive.
- Use Strict Mode during development to catch hidden bugs early.

---

### **Concurrent Mode: Interruptible, Prioritized Rendering**

#### 1. What Is Concurrent Mode?

Concurrent Mode (opt-in in React 18 via `createRoot`) allows React to:

- Pause a render in mid-flight if a higher-priority update arrives.
- Resume it later from where it left off.
- Abandon renders that are no longer relevant.

This transforms rendering from an all-or-nothing blocking task into a cooperative, interruptible process.

#### 2. Scheduling & Lanes

React 18 introduces lanes—conceptual priority buckets:

- **Synchronous Lane:** Urgent updates (e.g., setState inside an event handler).
- **Transition Lane:** Non-urgent updates marked via `startTransition`.
- **Idle Lane:** Background tasks React runs when the browser is free.

When you call `startTransition`, you move that update into a lower lane. React will:

- Render all urgent work first (keeping clicks and inputs responsive).
- Then resume your transition work (e.g., filtering a large list).
- If the transition is taking too long, React can show your `<Suspense fallback>` UI.

#### 3. Integration with Hydration & Paint

- **Hydration as a Concurrent Task:** Hydration itself now happens in lanes—React can prioritize binding event handlers on interactive parts before hydrating the rest of the page.
- **Hydration + Paint:** By streaming HTML and then hydrating high-priority Suspense regions first, you shorten the time from FCP to interactivity on user-critical features.

##### **Real-World Flow Example**

Server streams HTML:

```html
<!-- sent immediately -->
<div id="app">
    <header><!-- hydrated fast --></header>
    <main><!-- Suspense boundary for search --></main>
    <footer><!-- lower priority --></footer>
</div>
```

- Browser paints the HTML → FCP occurs.
- `hydrateRoot` invokes hydration in a high-priority lane for `<header>` and `<main>`.
- User starts typing in the search box (inside `<main>`). Because hydration and interactions are now atomic and scheduled, input remains responsive even if the rest of the page is still hydrating.
- Search Update: You call `startTransition` to fetch or filter results. React defers that work to a transition lane, so typing and clicks don’t stall.
- Results Arrive: React renders them, and your Suspense boundary shows either a spinner or the new list—whenever the transition completes.

### Q. What is the virtual DOM? How does React’s reconciliation algorithm work?

#### **Virtual DOM (vDOM):**

The Virtual DOM is an in-memory, lightweight representation of the real DOM tree. When your app’s state changes, React:

1. Creates a new vDOM tree representing the updated UI.
2. Diffs it against the previous vDOM tree to find the minimal set of changes (a “patch”).
3. Applies only those changes to the real DOM.

This minimizes expensive DOM operations, improving performance.

#### **Reconciliation Algorithm (“Diffing”):**

- **Tree Diffing:** If the root element type changes, React tears down and rebuilds subtrees.
- **Component Diffing:** For the same element type, React shallow-compares props to decide whether to update that node.
- **List Diffing with Keys:** React uses the `key` prop to match items between old and new lists, so it can move or update only changed items.

---

### Q. Explain the difference between function components and class components. When might you still use a class?

- **Function Components:** Use hooks for state and lifecycle. Preferred for new code.
- **Class Components:** Use `this.state` and lifecycle methods.

**When to Still Use Class Components:**

- **Legacy Codebases:** If you’re gradually migrating to Hooks, you may maintain existing class components.
- **Error Boundaries:** As of React 18, Error Boundaries must be class components (though RFCs may change this).

**Example:**
- New feature panels (e.g., real-time chart widgets) built with function components and Hooks.
- Core error-handling wrappers (Error Boundaries) remain as class components.

---

### Q. How do JSX and Babel work under the hood?

#### **JSX:**

JSX is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript. Under the hood, each JSX tag compiles to a `React.createElement` call:

```jsx
// JSX
const btn = <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;

// After Babel compilation
const btn = React.createElement(
    "button",
    { onClick: handleClick },
    "Click me"
);
```

#### **Babel’s Role:**

- **Parsing:** Babel parses your `.jsx` files into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Transforming:** Babel’s `@babel/preset-react` plugin transforms JSX nodes into `React.createElement` calls.
- **Polyfilling (if configured):** Adds any required polyfills (e.g., for older browsers).
- **Bundling:** Tools like Webpack or Vite then bundle/transpile further (e.g., down to ES5).

---

### Q. What are React elements versus React components?

- **React Element:** The smallest building block. It’s a plain object returned by `React.createElement`, describing what to render (type, props, children). Elements are immutable.
- **React Component:** A function or class that accepts props and returns React elements. Components let you encapsulate and reuse UI logic.

```js
// Element
const el = React.createElement("h1", { className: "title" }, "Hello");

// Component
function Greeting({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>; // JSX → React.createElement(...)
}
```

---

### Q. How do keys work in lists? Why are they important?

A key is a special prop you pass to list items to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed.

- They must be unique among siblings and stable across renders (e.g., use database IDs, not array indices).

```jsx
// Bad: using index can lead to bugs when list order changes
{items.map((item, idx) => (
    <Task key={idx} data={item} />
))}

// Good: use a stable, unique ID
{items.map(item => (
    <Task key={item.id} data={item} />
))}
```

**Why Keys Matter:**

- **Performance:** Minimizes DOM manipulations by reusing existing elements when possible.
- **State Preservation:** If a child component holds internal state (e.g., an input’s cursor position), a stable key ensures React re-uses the correct DOM node instead of recreating it, which would reset state.



## 2. Advanced Hooks & Patterns

---

### Q. Dive deep into `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue`. Give a use-case example.

#### 1. API & Conceptual Overview

**`useTransition`**

- **Signature:**
    ```js
    const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
    ```
- **Purpose:**  
    Mark state updates as “non-urgent,” letting React yield to urgent updates (like typing or clicks) and avoid janky UI.
- **Behavior:**  
    - Updates wrapped in `startTransition` are deprioritized.
    - Urgent updates (e.g., input value) are always processed immediately.
    - `isPending` is `true` while the transition is ongoing.

**`useDeferredValue`**

- **Signature:**
    ```js
    const deferred = useDeferredValue(value, { timeoutMs?: number });
    ```
- **Purpose:**  
    Returns a deferred copy of a fast-changing value, so expensive work doesn’t run on every keystroke.
- **Behavior:**  
    - React updates the deferred value only when it can do so without blocking urgent renders.
    - `timeoutMs` ensures the deferred value eventually catches up.

---

#### 2. Why & When to Use Them

| Concern           | `useTransition`                                                                 | `useDeferredValue`                                               |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UX “Jank”         | Batch large updates (e.g., navigation, filtering) without blocking interactions | Avoid re-rendering heavy trees on every minor change             |
| Loading States    | Show spinners/placeholders during a transition                                  | Gracefully degrade UI updates until workload is done             |
| Priority Mgmt     | Explicitly demote certain renders to low priority                               | Implicitly defer a changing prop without refactoring components  |

---

#### 3. Internal Mechanics

- **Scheduling Lanes:**  
    React 18 introduces “lanes” for concurrent rendering. `useTransition` moves updates into a slower lane.
- **Timeouts & Fallbacks:**  
    - If a transition takes too long, React can show fallback UI (e.g., a spinner).
    - `useDeferredValue` flushes the deferred value after `timeoutMs` if updates stall.

---

#### 4. Practical Use-Case Example: Filterable Data Table

**Scenario:**  
A data-heavy admin dashboard displays a table of 10,000+ rows. Users filter via a search box, but you don’t want the table to freeze on every keystroke.

**Without Transitions/Deferrals:**  
- Each keystroke updates filter state.
- React re-renders the entire table on every character → noticeable lag.

**With `useDeferredValue`:**
```jsx
function UserTable({ users }) {
    const [filter, setFilter] = useState('');
    // Defer the filter so table updates lag behind typing
    const deferredFilter = useDeferredValue(filter, { timeoutMs: 200 });

    const filteredUsers = useMemo(
        () =>
            users.filter(u =>
                u.name.toLowerCase().includes(deferredFilter.toLowerCase())
            ),
        [users, deferredFilter]
    );

    return (
        <>
            <input
                value={filter}
                onChange={e => setFilter(e.target.value)} // urgent update
                placeholder="Search users..."
            />
            {filter !== deferredFilter && <p>Searching...</p>}
            <DataGrid rows={filteredUsers} />
        </>
    );
}
```
- **What Happens:**  
    Typing feels instant (input is urgent). The big table rerenders only when React is free, and a “Searching…” indicator shows while pending.

**With `useTransition`:**
```jsx
function Dashboard() {
    const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
    const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
    const [results, setResults] = useState([]);

    const handleFilter = q => {
        setQuery(q); // urgent: reflect input immediately
        startTransition(() => {
            const filtered = expensiveFilter(allData, q);
            setResults(filtered);
        });
    };

    return (
        <>
            <input
                value={query}
                onChange={e => handleFilter(e.target.value)}
            />
            {isPending && <LoadingSpinner />}
            <DataGrid rows={results} />
        </>
    );
}
```
- **What Happens:**  
    Typing remains smooth because heavy filtering and table update are deferred. Show `<LoadingSpinner />` while `isPending`.

---

#### 5. Pitfalls & Best Practices

- **Don’t overuse transitions:** Only wrap truly heavy or non-urgent updates.
- **Dependency hygiene:** Always list deferred values in `useMemo`/`useEffect` dependencies.
- **Fallback UI:** Provide subtle cues (`isPending` or `value !== deferredValue`) so users know something is happening.
- **Timeouts:** Tune `timeoutMs` in `useDeferredValue` to balance freshness vs. jankiness.

---

### Q. What problem does `useSyncExternalStore` solve? How would you implement a custom store subscription?

**Summary:**  
`useSyncExternalStore` is a reliable way to “listen” to something outside React (global settings, WebSocket, browser window) and always read its latest value without missing updates.

**Problem before:**  
A `useEffect` that reads the value and then subscribes could miss updates between those steps, causing out-of-sync state.

**What the hook does:**
- Reads the value first.
- Sets up the subscription at exactly the right moment.
- Keeps your component in sync, even if React pauses or restarts renders.
- Lets you define a server value for perfect SSR/CSR hydration.

**Example: Responsive Layout via Window Width**

```js
// windowStore.js
export function getWidth() {
    return window.innerWidth;
}
export function subscribeToResize(callback) {
    window.addEventListener('resize', callback);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', callback);
}
```
```js
// useWindowWidth.js
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';
import { getWidth, subscribeToResize } from './windowStore';

export function useWindowWidth() {
    const subscribe = (onChange) => subscribeToResize(onChange);
    const getSnapshot = () => getWidth();
    const getServerSnapshot = () => 1024; // default for SSR

    return useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot, getServerSnapshot);
}
```
```jsx
// ResponsiveSidebar.jsx
import { useWindowWidth } from './useWindowWidth';

function ResponsiveSidebar({ children }) {
    const width = useWindowWidth();
    return width < 768
        ? <TopNav>{children}</TopNav>
        : <Sidebar>{children}</Sidebar>;
}
```

**Why this is safe and simple:**
- Always up-to-date: Never miss a resize event.
- No flicker: Server and client start with the same width.
- Easy to reuse: Encapsulates subscribe + read logic.

Use `useSyncExternalStore` for any external data source (global store, WebSocket, browser APIs) for guaranteed consistency, even under concurrent rendering.

---

### Q. Describe `useInsertionEffect` and why it was introduced.

**`useInsertionEffect`** is a special React 18 hook for style libraries to inject or update CSS right after React updates the DOM, but before the browser calculates layout or paints.

**Why “insertion”?**  
Dynamic CSS (e.g., styled-components, emotion) must be in the document before layout, or you get a flash of unstyled/mis-styled content.

**Why a new hook?**  
Concurrent rendering means renders can pause/resume unpredictably. Injecting styles in `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect` was too late or could race, causing flicker or ordering bugs.

**Summary:**
1. React updates the DOM.
2. `useInsertionEffect` runs: styles are inserted.
3. `useLayoutEffect` runs.
4. Browser paints with correct styles—no flash, no mix-ups.

You normally won’t call `useInsertionEffect` yourself; it’s for CSS-in-JS libraries to ensure styles always land at the right moment.



## Q. How do you build your own custom hook? What are best practices for hook design and sharing?

Creating a custom hook means packaging up stateful logic (often using React’s built-in hooks) so it can be reused across components. Here’s a step-by-step guide and best practices for designing, testing, and sharing your own hooks.

---

### 1. Anatomy of a Custom Hook

- **Name it with `use...`**  
    React enforces the “Rules of Hooks” by looking for functions whose names start with `use`. Always name your hook `useXxx`.

- **Call built-in hooks at the top level**  
    Inside your custom hook, call `useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, etc., unconditionally at the top level. Don’t put them in loops, conditionals, or nested functions.

- **Encapsulate one concern**  
    Each hook should solve one problem (e.g., “debounce a value,” “fetch data,” “track mouse position”). If you find yourself mixing unrelated logic, break it into smaller hooks.

- **Return a stable API**  
    Return a tuple or object of values and updater functions. If you return functions, wrap them in `useCallback` so they don’t change on every render.

---

### 2. Example: `useFetch` Hook

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';

export function useFetch(url, options) {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

    const fetchData = useCallback(async () => {
        setLoading(true);
        setError(null);
        try {
            const res = await fetch(url, options);
            if (!res.ok) throw new Error(res.statusText);
            const json = await res.json();
            setData(json);
        } catch (err) {
            setError(err);
        } finally {
            setLoading(false);
        }
    }, [url, options]);

    useEffect(() => {
        fetchData();
    }, [fetchData]);

    return { data, error, loading, refetch: fetchData };
}
```

**How to use in a component:**

```jsx
function UserList() {
    const { data: users, loading, error, refetch } = useFetch('/api/users');

    if (loading) return <p>Loading…</p>;
    if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;

    return (
        <>
            <button onClick={refetch}>Reload</button>
            <ul>{users.map(u => <li key={u.id}>{u.name}</li>)}</ul>
        </>
    );
}
```

---

### 3. Best Practices for Hook Design

- **Single Responsibility**  
    Keep each hook focused. Compose hooks inside other hooks to build more complex behavior.

- **Stable References**  
    - Wrap callbacks in `useCallback`.
    - Memoize derived data with `useMemo` if it’s expensive.
    - This lets consumers pass your hook’s outputs into dependency arrays without endless re-renders.

- **Clear Return Value**  
    - If you return multiple items, use an object so order changes don’t break callers.
    - Document what each field represents.

- **Handle Cleanup**  
    Always clean up timers, subscriptions, or event listeners in the effect’s cleanup function to avoid leaks.

- **Parameter Defaults & Validation**  
    Provide sane defaults for optional parameters. Optionally throw early if required parameters are missing or invalid.

- **Testability**  
    - Export your hook’s core reducer or logic function separately so you can unit-test it in isolation.
    - In component tests, wrap a dummy component and use React Testing Library’s `renderHook` to assert hook behavior.

---

### 4. Sharing & Packaging Hooks

- **Internal Libraries:** Group related hooks (e.g., data-fetching hooks, UI-state hooks) into shared modules within your monorepo or shared codebase.
- **Public Packages:**  
    - Use TypeScript declarations (`.d.ts`) or JSDoc for clear typing.
    - Write examples and usage guides.
    - Semantic version your package so breaking changes are signaled to consumers.
- **Documentation:** Maintain a living style guide or Storybook stories demonstrating each hook’s behavior and edge cases.
- **Versioning & Deprecation:** If you need to change a hook’s API, consider deprecating the old version first, log warnings, then remove in a major version.

---

## Q. Explain React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback—what do they memoize, and what pitfalls can they introduce?

`React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` all help you avoid unnecessary work by memoizing (caching) the results of computations or function references so React can skip re-running them unless their inputs change.

---

### 1. `React.memo`

- **What it memoizes:**  
    Wraps a component and shallow-compares its props between renders. If props are the same (by shallow equality), React skips re-rendering that component subtree.

- **Usage:**
    ```jsx
    const MyButton = React.memo(function Button({ onClick, label }) {
        console.log('Rendering button', label);
        return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
    });
    ```
    On parent renders, if `label` and `onClick` references are stable, `<MyButton>` won’t re-render.

- **Pitfalls:**
    - **Prop Identity:**  
        Passing inline objects, arrays, or functions recreates them each render, defeating memoization:
        ```jsx
        <MyButton
            onClick={() => doSomething(item.id)}  // new function each time
            label={item.label}
        />
        ```
        *Fix:* Use `useCallback` or move the function definition outside render.

    - **Shallow Comparison Only:**  
        Deeply nested props won’t be compared deeply. Changing a nested field still counts as a change.

    - **Overuse Overhead:**  
        Memoizing every leaf component adds comparison cost. Only wrap components that actually re-render frequently and are expensive.

---

### 2. `useMemo`

- **What it memoizes:**  
    A computed value (return value of a function) between renders, recalculating only when its dependency array changes.

- **Usage:**
    ```jsx
    const filtered = useMemo(
        () => items.filter(u => u.active),
        [items]
    );
    ```
    `filtered` is recomputed only when the `items` array reference changes.

- **Pitfalls:**
    - **False Dependency Assumptions:**  
        Omitting a dependency leads to stale values; including too many leads to unnecessary recomputations.  
        *Fix:* Rely on ESLint’s `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule.

    - **Cheap Computations:**  
        Wrapping trivial calculations in `useMemo` can slow performance more than it helps.

    - **Referential Equality Isn’t Free:**  
        If you return a new object/array, its reference changes unless memoized—use `useMemo` for objects you pass down to children to keep their props stable.

---

### 3. `useCallback`

- **What it memoizes:**  
    A function reference between renders, recreating it only when dependencies change.

- **Usage:**
    ```jsx
    const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
        setCount(c => c + 1);
    }, []);
    ```
    `handleClick` keeps the same identity across renders, so you can safely pass it to memoized children.

- **Pitfalls:**
    - **Over-Memoization:**  
        Wrapping every function in `useCallback` adds overhead; only use when passing callbacks to deep children or dependencies of other hooks.

    - **Stale Closures:**  
        The callback “closes over” variables from its creation render; if you omit a dependency (e.g., a state value), your callback may use outdated values.  
        *Fix:* List all external variables in the dependency array.

    - **Dependency Complexity:**  
        Complex dependency arrays can lead to either too-frequent recreation (if you include everything) or bugs (if you include too little). Lean on ESLint to keep arrays accurate.

---

### When to Use Each

| Scenario                                   | Solution                      |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Prevent re-render of a child component      | Wrap it in `React.memo`       |
| Avoid re-filtering/re-computing on each render | Wrap computation in `useMemo` |
| Keep callback identity stable across renders | Wrap function in `useCallback`|

---

### Lead-Level Best Practices

- **Measure Before Memoizing:**  
    Use React DevTools Profiler to confirm that a component truly renders too often or that a computation is expensive.

- **Keep Memoization Shallow:**  
    Memoize at the granularity that makes sense—don’t wrap trivial components or functions unless there’s a demonstrated need.

- **Leverage ESLint Rules:**  
    Enable `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` to auto-enforce correct dependencies for `useMemo` and `useCallback`.

- **Prefer Declarative Data Flow:**  
    Sometimes it’s simpler to restructure your components (e.g., lift state up, split contexts) than to sprinkle memoization everywhere.

- **Document Intent:**  
    When you memoize, add a comment explaining why it’s necessary—so future maintainers know not to remove it lightly.




## Q. How do you optimize large lists in React? (e.g., windowing with react-window or react-virtualized)

When rendering hundreds or thousands of items in a list or table, React creates a DOM node for each item—even those off-screen. This leads to:

- **Heavy memory usage**
- **Slow initial render**
- **Janky scrolling** (browser must lay out and paint every item)

**Windowing** (a.k.a. “virtualization”) solves this by only rendering the visible subset of items (plus a small buffer). As the user scrolls, DOM nodes are recycled to show new items, giving the illusion of a full list while keeping the DOM lightweight.

### 1. Core Concepts of Windowing

- **Viewport Measurement**: Measure the container’s height (and scroll position) to know which items should appear.
- **Item Size**:
    - *Fixed size*: All items share the same height/width.
    - *Variable size*: Each item can have a different size—requires more bookkeeping.
- **Overscan**: Render a few items beyond the visible window (e.g., 2–5 items) to avoid gaps during scrolling.
- **Recycling**: Instead of creating/destroying DOM nodes for every scroll, existing nodes are re-positioned and their content updated.

---

## Q. Describe code-splitting and lazy loading via React.lazy and Suspense. What tradeoffs exist?

Here’s how code-splitting and lazy loading work in React using `React.lazy` and `<Suspense>`, plus key trade-offs.

### 1. What Is Code-Splitting?

Code-splitting breaks your JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks loaded on demand, rather than shipping the entire app in one file. This reduces:

- **Initial bundle size** → faster First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- **Time to Interactive** → less JavaScript to parse/execute

Configure this at build time via your bundler (Webpack, Vite, etc.) using dynamic `import()` calls.

### 2. React.lazy + Suspense: The Basics

**React.lazy**  
Wraps a dynamic `import()` so React knows it’s a lazily-loaded component:

```jsx
import { lazy } from 'react';

const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./Dashboard'));
const Settings  = lazy(() => import('./Settings'));
```
Each `import()` becomes a separate chunk file (e.g. `Dashboard.[hash].js`).

**<Suspense>**  
Defines a “loading” boundary around lazy components:

```jsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';

function App() {
    return (
        <Router>
            <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
                <Routes>
                    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
                    <Route path="/settings"  element={<Settings />} />
                </Routes>
            </Suspense>
        </Router>
    );
}
```
- `fallback`: JSX shown while the chunk is loading.
- You can nest multiple `<Suspense>`s for granular loading states.

### 3. Trade-Offs & Considerations

| Benefit                     | Trade-Off / Risk                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Smaller initial bundle      | More network requests: each lazy module is a separate HTTP fetch                 |
| On-demand loading           | Waterfall delays: visible loading spinners if chunks load slowly                 |
| Better Time-to-Interactive  | Complexity: needs `<Suspense>` boundaries and fallbacks everywhere               |
| Granular UX control         | Error handling: must wrap in an Error Boundary to catch load failures            |
| Tree-shaking remains effective | SSR/SSG limitations: React.lazy+Suspense isn’t directly supported in server render—requires frameworks like Next.js or Remix |

### 4. Lead-Level Best Practices

- **Chunk Strategy**: Group related routes or heavy components into the same chunk to avoid too many small files. Use webpack’s `/* webpackChunkName: "admin" */` magic comments to name chunks.
- **Preloading & Prefetching**: Use `<link rel="preload">` or webpack’s `/* webpackPrefetch: true */` to fetch chunks after initial load.
- **Granular Suspense Boundaries**: Place boundaries around each major route/widget for targeted skeletons, not a global spinner.
- **Error Boundaries**: Always pair lazy components with an Error Boundary to catch failed imports and provide a retry UI.
- **SSR/SSG Integration**: For server rendering, use framework-specific solutions (Next.js dynamic imports, Remix’s `<Await>`, or React 18’s SSR Suspense).

---

## Q. How would you reduce bundle size? Talk about tree-shaking, dynamic imports, and analyzing bundles with tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer.

Reducing bundle size is critical for fast load times, better performance, and improved user experience. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Tree-Shaking: Dead-Code Elimination

**What it is:**  
Tree-shaking statically analyzes your module graph to remove unused (“dead”) code.

**How to enable it:**

- Use ES Modules (`import`/`export`) rather than CommonJS (`require`/`module.exports`).
- In Webpack, set `mode: 'production'` (enables `optimization.usedExports`) or explicitly `optimization: { usedExports: true, sideEffects: false }`.
- Ensure your `package.json` declares `"sideEffects": false` (or lists only files with side-effects).

**Best practices:**

- Prefer named exports:
    ```js
    // Good
    export function foo() {}
    export function bar() {}

    // Bad
    const foo = () => {};
    const bar = () => {};
    export { foo, bar };
    ```
- Mark CSS or polyfill files as side-effectful if needed (e.g., `"sideEffects": ["*.css"]`).

**How It Works (High-Level):**

- Parse the module graph from entry points.
- Mark “used” exports.
- Eliminate unused exports and their dependencies.

**Example:**

```js
// utils.js
export function camelCase(str) { /* … */ }
export function kebabCase(str) { /* … */ }
export function snakeCase(str) { /* … */ }

// app.js
import { camelCase } from './utils';
console.log(camelCase('hello world'));
```
With tree shaking, only `camelCase` is included in the bundle.

---

### 2. Dynamic Imports & Code-Splitting

**What it is:**  
Dynamic `import()` lets you split your bundle into smaller chunks loaded on demand.

**Usage in React:**

```jsx
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const HeavyComponent = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));

function App() {
    return (
        <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
            <HeavyComponent />
        </Suspense>
    );
}
```

**When to split:**

- Route-level splitting: Lazy-load entire pages/routes.
- Component-level splitting: Lazy-load rarely used widgets.
- Feature gating: Load code only when users unlock a feature.

**Advanced hints:**

- **Prefetching:**
    ```js
    const Admin = lazy(() =>
        import('./Admin' /* webpackPrefetch: true */)
    );
    ```
- **Preloading:**
    ```js
    import(/* webpackPreload: true */ './CriticalWidget');
    ```

---

### 3. Analyzing Bundles

Before optimizing, analyze your bundle contents.

**Webpack Bundle Analyzer**

- Install:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
    ```
- Configure:
    ```js
    // webpack.config.js
    const { BundleAnalyzerPlugin } = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer');

    module.exports = {
        // ...
        plugins: [
            new BundleAnalyzerPlugin({ 
                analyzerMode: 'static', // generates report.html 
                openAnalyzer: false 
            })
        ]
    };
    ```
- Run your build:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
- Open `report.html` to see a treemap of your chunks.

**Other tools:**

- Source Map Explorer (`source-map-explorer dist/main.js`)
- Rollup Plugin Visualizer

**What to look for:**

- Big dependencies
- Duplicate code (e.g., two versions of lodash)
- Unused locales/assets (e.g., moment.js locales)

---

### 4. Complementary Techniques

- **Replace Heavy Dependencies**: Swap `moment.js` (~67 KB gzipped) for `date-fns` or `dayjs` (~10 KB gzipped).
- **Use modular imports:**
    ```js
    // Bad: imports entire lodash
    import _ from 'lodash';
    // Good: only import what you need
    import debounce from 'lodash/debounce';
    ```



## 4. State Management & Data Layers

### Q. Compare local component state, Context API, Redux, MobX, Zustand, Recoil, etc. Why choose one?

When architecting state in a React app, you have three broad tiers to choose from:

- **Local Component State** (`useState` / `useReducer`)
- **Context API**
- **External Stores** (e.g. Redux, MobX, Zustand, Recoil)

Each has its sweet spot—here’s how they compare and when you’d pick one over the others.

---

#### 1. Local Component State

**What it is:**  
State that lives inside a function (or class) component via `useState`/`useReducer`.

```jsx
function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    // …
}
```

**Pros:**
- **Simplicity:** No extra libraries or boilerplate.
- **Encapsulation:** State is owned and updated only by the component that needs it.
- **Optimized renders:** Only that component (and its children) re-render when state changes.

**Cons:**
- **Prop drilling:** Sharing state across deep trees requires passing props down multiple levels.
- **Repetition:** Re-implementing the same “share/subscribe” logic across many components.

**When to Use:**  
Self-contained widgets: modals, form inputs, toggles, dropdowns.  
State that never needs to cross “module” boundaries.

---

#### 2. Context API

**What it is:**  
A built-in React feature that lets you broadcast a value (and updater) to any nested consumer, without passing props at every level.

```jsx
const AuthContext = createContext();

function AuthProvider({ children }) {
    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
    return (
        <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
            {children}
        </AuthContext.Provider>
    );
}

// In any child:
const { user, setUser } = useContext(AuthContext);
```

**Pros:**
- **No prop drilling:** Consumers anywhere can read or update context.
- **Lightweight:** No external dependencies.
- **Scoped:** You can have many independent contexts (theme, auth, locale).

**Cons:**
- **Performance:** Any change to the context value re-renders all consumers (unless you split contexts or memoize).
- **Boilerplate for updates:** You still need to write provider logic (setUser, reducers, etc.).
- **Less tooling:** Context has no devtools or middleware.

**When to Use:**  
Cross-cutting concerns: Auth state, theme, locale, feature flags.  
Moderate complexity: When you have a few global values that rarely change.

---

#### 3. Redux (or Other External Store)

**What it is:**  
A standalone store (often immutable) with a well-defined pattern: actions → reducer → new state. Components subscribe via `useSelector` and dispatch via `useDispatch`.

```js
// counterSlice.js
const counterSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'counter',
    initialState: 0,
    reducers: {
        increment: state => state + 1,
        decrement: state => state - 1
    }
});
export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;

// In component
const count = useSelector(state => state.counter);
const dispatch = useDispatch();
```

**Pros:**
- **Predictability:** Single source of truth; state changes follow strict, testable patterns.
- **DevTools:** Time-travel debugging, action logging.
- **Middleware ecosystem:** Easy to plug in async logic, logging, analytics.
- **Scalability:** Well-suited to large apps with complex state interactions.

**Cons:**
- **Boilerplate:** Action definitions, reducers, wiring up the store.
- **Overkill for small apps:** Can add unnecessary complexity if you only need a little shared state.
- **Learning curve:** The strict architectural pattern can slow down new team members.

**When to Use:**  
Large–scale apps: Many moving parts, multiple teams.  
Complex interactions: Extensive async flows, undo/redo, cross-domain state changes.  
Need for tooling: Want Redux DevTools, middleware, sagas/thunks.

---

#### Real-World Project Example

**E-commerce dashboard:**

- **Local State:**  
    - Toggling a “Sort By” dropdown in a product list.
    - Managing a modal’s open/closed state for image previews.

- **Context API:**  
    - Storing the current user’s theme (light/dark) and exposing `toggleTheme` everywhere.
    - Providing authentication info (user, login, logout) to navbars, protected routes, and API hooks.

- **Redux:**  
    - Managing the shopping cart: adding/removing items, persisting to localStorage, complex promotion logic.
    - Handling order processing flows: async calls, error states, rollback on failure.
    - Logging and replaying actions to reproduce bugs or provide audit trails.

---

### Q. How do you architect a scalable state-management solution for a large application?

Architecting a scalable state-management solution for a large React application requires balancing performance, maintainability, team collaboration, and domain complexity. Each tier of state should be managed appropriately.

#### 🧠 First, Categorize Your State

Split your app state into three scopes:

| Scope              | Examples                                 | Tool Recommendation           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Local/UI State     | Form inputs, modals, toggles, dropdowns  | `useState`, `useReducer`     |
| App-Wide (Global)  | Auth, theme, notifications, cart         | Context or Redux             |
| Server/Remote State| API data, loading/error flags, pagination| React Query, SWR, RTK Query  |

---

#### 🏗️ Architecture Layers

**1. Local State – `useState`/`useReducer`**  
Design Tip: Keep local state local. For example, don’t use Redux for a modal toggle.

- Use `useState` for simple values.
- Use `useReducer` when state transitions depend on complex logic or multiple actions.

**Good Practice:**  
Encapsulate logic using custom hooks.

```js
function useToggle(initial = false) {
    const [state, set] = useState(initial);
    const toggle = () => set(s => !s);
    return [state, toggle];
}
```

---

**2. Shared Context – React Context API**  
Use this for cross-cutting concerns like:

- Authentication
- Theme (light/dark)
- Language/Locale
- Feature Flags

To scale safely:
- Split contexts by domain (e.g., `AuthContext`, `ThemeContext`).
- Use `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Use `useReducer` inside Provider if your state is complex.

```jsx
<AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}>
    {/* children */}
</AuthContext.Provider>
```

---

**3. Global App State – Redux (or Zustand/Jotai/Recoil)**  
Use Redux or a similar library when:

- You have shared state used by many parts of the app.
- The state needs to be predictable, testable, debuggable.
- You need middleware (e.g. logging, analytics, async flows).
- You need DevTools to inspect app behavior.

Use Redux Toolkit (RTK) for:
- `createSlice` to avoid boilerplate.
- `createAsyncThunk` for side-effects.
- RTK Query for API integration with caching and normalization.

✨ Consider Zustand or Jotai for simpler APIs without Redux boilerplate in medium-scale apps.

---

### Q. Explain “lifting state up” vs. colocated state. When do you pick one?

#### 🏋️ What is Lifting State Up?

**Definition:**  
Moving state to the closest common ancestor of multiple components that need to share or coordinate that state.

**Why do it?**  
React promotes unidirectional data flow. If two components need to talk to each other via state, that state must live above them and be passed down.

---

**Example: A Temperature Converter**

You have two inputs—Celsius and Fahrenheit. When one updates, the other should reflect the change.

```jsx
function TemperatureConverter() {
    const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState('');

    return (
        <>
            <CelsiusInput value={temperature} onChange={setTemperature} />
            <FahrenheitInput value={temperature} onChange={setTemperature} />
        </>
    );
}
```
Here, `temperature` is lifted up to the parent so both children can coordinate.

**Use Case:** Two sibling components (input fields) need to share the same state.

---

**Parent component – shared state**

```jsx
function Parent() {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');

    return (
        <div>
            <InputA name={name} onNameChange={setName} />
            <InputB name={name} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

**Child A – updates the name**

```jsx
function InputA({ name, onNameChange }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <label>Input A:</label>
            <input
                value={name}
                onChange={(e) => onNameChange(e.target.value)}
            />
        </div>
    );
}
```

**Child B – reads the same name**

```jsx
function InputB({ name }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <label>Input B:</label>
            <input value={name} readOnly />
        </div>
    );
}
```


## 11. Architecture & Design

### Q. How do you design a micro-frontend architecture with React?

Designing a micro-frontend architecture with React involves breaking a large application into smaller, independently deployable React apps that work together as a single cohesive UI. This is similar to microservices, but for the frontend.

---

#### 🧠 What is Micro-Frontend Architecture?

A design pattern where a monolithic frontend is divided into feature-based, independently deployable apps, each owned by a different team. Teams can use their own tech stack (though React is often standardized for consistency).

---

#### ✅ When to Use Micro-Frontends

| Use If...                                 | Avoid If...                          |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Your app is huge and has multiple domains | App is small or medium-sized         |
| Multiple teams work in parallel           | Single-team project                  |
| Independent deployments are needed        | Deployment frequency is low          |
| You want isolated failure domains         | Simplicity is more important         |

---

#### 🏗️ Key Principles of Designing Micro-Frontends with React

- **Independent Deployment**
- **Isolated Builds**
- **Technology Agnostic** (optional)
- **Seamless User Experience**
- **Shared Contracts or Design Systems**

---

#### 📦 Folder / Project Structure

```
root/
├── container-app/        # Shell/host app (router, layout)
├── mfe-auth/             # Micro-frontend: Auth feature
├── mfe-dashboard/        # Micro-frontend: Dashboard feature
├── shared-lib/           # Shared components/hooks (optional)
└── .github/workflows/    # CI/CD per micro-app
```

---

#### 🧩 Integration Approaches

1. **Module Federation (Webpack 5) – Recommended**

  Each micro-frontend exposes parts of itself (components, pages) via `webpack.config.js` and is consumed by a container (host app).

  **Benefits:**
  - Native dynamic loading of remote modules
  - Shared dependencies across apps
  - Independent deployments

  **Host (Container App) – webpack.config.js**
  ```js
  new ModuleFederationPlugin({
    name: 'container',
    remotes: {
     auth: 'auth@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js',
     dashboard: 'dashboard@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js',
    },
    shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
  })
  ```

  **Micro-frontend (e.g., Auth) – webpack.config.js**
  ```js
  new ModuleFederationPlugin({
    name: 'auth',
    filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
    exposes: {
     './Login': './src/Login',
    },
    shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
  })
  ```

2. **iframe-based Embeds**

  For truly isolated apps (e.g., using different frameworks), embed via `<iframe>`. Good for admin panels or isolated analytics tools.  
  _Tradeoff: No shared state or styling._

3. **Runtime Integration via Web Components or Single SPA**

  Use [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) to load apps dynamically and mount/unmount them at runtime.

---

#### 🧪 Example: Container Consuming Remote Component

```tsx
// ContainerApp.jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const RemoteLogin = React.lazy(() => import('auth/Login'));

function App() {
  return (
   <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <RemoteLogin />
   </Suspense>
  );
}
```

---

#### 🧱 Shared Component Library (Optional)

To maintain consistency (design system, icons, buttons), create a shared package using tools like:

- Storybook for documentation
- Rollup to bundle
- npm / GitHub Packages to publish

---

#### 🚀 CI/CD and Deployment

Each micro-frontend:

- Has its own pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Publishes a new `remoteEntry.js` with each release
- Is versioned and deployed independently

In production, remotes are loaded from CDN or different domains.

---

#### 🔐 Cross-App Concerns

| Concern         | Strategy                                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication  | Centralized auth provider (e.g., auth micro-frontend/context)|
| Global State    | Use shared store (Zustand/Redux) or local state              |
| Routing         | Centralized routing in container or per-micro routing        |
| Error boundaries| Wrap each micro-app to prevent full app crashes              |

---

#### 🧠 Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Independent development and deployments
- Smaller bundles and faster initial loads
- Fault isolation (one app crash doesn’t kill all)

**Cons:**
- Complexity in build setup (especially Module Federation)
- Version mismatch issues
- Shared state or navigation is harder
- CSS conflicts (should use CSS modules or scopes)

---

#### 🧪 Real-World Example

Imagine an e-commerce platform:

| Micro-Frontend | Domain                        |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| mfe-auth       | Login, register, SSO         |
| mfe-product    | Product catalog, filters      |
| mfe-cart       | Cart & checkout               |
| mfe-admin      | Admin dashboards              |
| container-app  | Top nav, shell layout, routes |

Each can be developed, tested, deployed, and rolled back independently.

---

### Q. What patterns do you use to decouple UI from business logic (e.g., container/presenter, hooks, service layers)?

Decoupling UI from business logic in a React application is essential for building scalable, testable, and maintainable codebases. The key goal is separation of concerns: letting the UI focus on rendering, and delegating state, side effects, and logic to well-defined layers.

---

#### 🧩 Common Patterns to Decouple UI from Logic

1. **Container / Presentational Components**

  - **Presentational (dumb) components:** Only concern is how things look.
  - **Container (smart) components:** Handle state, data fetching, business logic.

  **Example:**
  ```tsx
  // ProductCard (Presentational)
  const ProductCard = ({ name, price, onBuy }) => (
    <div>
     <h3>{name}</h3>
     <p>${price}</p>
     <button onClick={onBuy}>Buy</button>
    </div>
  );
  ```

  ```tsx
  // ProductCardContainer (Container)
  import { useProduct } from '@/hooks/useProduct';

  const ProductCardContainer = ({ productId }) => {
    const { data, buy } = useProduct(productId);
    return <ProductCard name={data.name} price={data.price} onBuy={buy} />;
  };
  ```

2. **Custom Hooks**

  Encapsulate reusable business logic (data fetching, state machines, validation) inside custom hooks, keeping components lean.

  **Example:**
  ```tsx
  // useAuth.ts
  export function useAuth() {
    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

    useEffect(() => {
     const unsub = firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(setUser);
     return () => unsub();
    }, []);

    return { user, isLoggedIn: !!user };
  }

  // In component
  const Header = () => {
    const { user, isLoggedIn } = useAuth();
    return <div>{isLoggedIn ? `Hi, ${user.name}` : 'Login'}</div>;
  };
  ```
  _Business logic (auth) lives in the hook, not the component._

3. **Service Layers (Pure Functions or Modules)**

  Move domain logic out of hooks/components into pure service functions.

  **Example:**
  ```ts
  // services/orderService.ts
  export function calculateTotal(cartItems: Item[]) {
    return cartItems.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
  }

  // In useCart.ts
  const total = calculateTotal(cart);
  ```

  _Hook → calls service → updates state → passes to UI._

4. **State Machines / Statecharts**

  For complex flows (checkout, onboarding), use state machines like [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/).

  ```tsx
  const checkoutMachine = createMachine({
    initial: 'cart',
    states: {
     cart: { on: { NEXT: 'address' } },
     address: { on: { NEXT: 'payment', BACK: 'cart' } },
     payment: { on: { SUBMIT: 'confirmation' } },
    },
  });
  ```

5. **Compound Components + Context**

  Group logically connected components (like `<Tabs>`, `<Tab>`) while sharing logic via context or internal hook.

  ```tsx
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="A" />
    <Tab title="B" />
  </Tabs>
  ```
  _Internal logic (active tab, handlers) is encapsulated inside Tabs using a context._

6. **Dependency Injection (advanced)**

  In larger apps, inject services like AuthService, ApiClient via context or props to decouple components from direct imports. Useful for SSR, mocking, or multi-tenant logic.

#### 🧠 When to Use What?

| Pattern             | Use When…                                      |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Container/Presenter | You want clear UI/logic separation; legacy code|
| Custom Hooks        | You want reusable, testable, encapsulated logic|
| Service Layer       | Logic is complex, shared, or needs unit testing|
| State Machines      | You have multi-step flows or business rules     |
| Compound Components | You’re building interactive UI primitives      |
| Dependency Injection| You need decoupled services for flexibility    |

#### 🧪 Real-World Example: E-Commerce Cart

```tsx
// useCart.ts (Hook = logic layer)
export function useCart() {
  const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);
  const addToCart = (item) => setCart((prev) => [...prev, item]);
  const total = calculateTotal(cart); // from services/cart.ts
  return { cart, addToCart, total };
}

// Cart.tsx (UI layer)
const Cart = () => {
  const { cart, addToCart, total } = useCart();
  return (
   <div>
    {cart.map((item) => <Item key={item.id} {...item} />)}
    <div>Total: {total}</div>
   </div>
  );
};
```
