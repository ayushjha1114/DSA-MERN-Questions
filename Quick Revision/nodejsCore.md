# Node.js Core Concepts: EventEmitter and Worker Threads

## 🔹 Understanding EventEmitter in Node.js

## 🌍 1. Why Node.js is Event-Driven

Node.js is designed around non-blocking I/O and uses an event loop to handle many operations concurrently. Instead of waiting for tasks like file reads, network calls, or timers, Node uses events to signal when a task is complete.  
**Event listeners** are core to Node’s architecture—they are the "reaction handlers" for these asynchronous events.

---

## 🧠 2. What Is an Event Listener?

An event listener in Node.js is a callback function registered to listen for a named event on an `EventEmitter` object.  
When the event is emitted, all listeners registered for that event are called synchronously in the order they were registered.

---

## 📦 3. The EventEmitter Class (Node Core Module)

All event-based logic in Node.js revolves around the `EventEmitter` class from the built-in `events` module.

```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
```

**Registering an Event Listener:**
```javascript
emitter.on('greet', (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});
```

**Emitting the Event:**
```javascript
emitter.emit('greet', 'Alice'); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

---

## 🔬 4. How It Works Internally

- `EventEmitter` maintains an internal map: `eventName → [listeners]`.
- When you call `emitter.on('event', listener)`, the listener is pushed to that list.
- When `emit('event')` is called, Node iterates over the list and executes each listener in order.
- Listeners are synchronous by default, unless you explicitly use `setImmediate()` or `process.nextTick()` inside the handler.

---

## 🧰 5. Useful EventEmitter Methods

- `.on(event, listener)` – Register a listener
- `.once(event, listener)` – Register a one-time listener
- `.emit(event, ...args)` – Trigger all listeners
- `.off(event, listener)` – Remove a specific listener (Node 10+)
- `.removeAllListeners(event)` – Useful for cleanup
- `.listenerCount(event)` – Inspect listener state
- `.setMaxListeners(n)` – Avoid memory leak warnings (default is 10)

---

## 💼 6. Real-World Use Cases

### ✅ a) Streams (File, Network, etc.)

Streams in Node emit events like `'data'`, `'end'`, `'error'`:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('./file.txt');

readStream.on('data', chunk => {
  console.log('Received chunk:', chunk);
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('Done reading file.');
});
```

### ✅ b) HTTP Servers

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello world');
});

server.on('request', (req, res) => {
  console.log(`Received request for ${req.url}`);
});

server.listen(3000);
```

### ✅ c) Custom Business Logic

You can use `EventEmitter` to decouple modules in an app:

```javascript
// notifier.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
class Notifier extends EventEmitter {}
module.exports = new Notifier();

// billing.js
const notifier = require('./notifier');
notifier.emit('invoicePaid', userId);

// email.js
const notifier = require('./notifier');
notifier.on('invoicePaid', (userId) => {
  // send confirmation email
});
```
> 📌 This creates a loose coupling between the billing and email systems.

---

## ⚠️ 7. Pitfalls and Best Practices

### ❌ Memory Leaks

Adding too many listeners without removing them can cause:

```
(node:12345) MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected.
```
**Fix:** Use `emitter.setMaxListeners()` or `.once()` when applicable.

### ✅ Always Clean Up Listeners

In long-running systems (like servers), ensure that listeners are removed if the context they belong to is destroyed.

```javascript
emitter.off('event', listener); // Clean removal
```

### ✅ Use `.once()` for One-Time Events

For things that should only happen once (like DB init, login success, etc.).

---

## 🧩 8. EventEmitter vs Pub/Sub vs Observer Pattern

- **EventEmitter:** Tight coupling (listeners and emitters must know the event name)
- **Pub/Sub (like Redis, RabbitMQ):** Decoupled and scalable across processes or machines

> Use `EventEmitter` within a single process. For microservices or distributed systems, use a true pub/sub mechanism.

---

## 🧪 9. Testing Event Emitters

You can test whether an event was emitted using libraries like Jest:

```javascript
test('emits done', () => {
  const emitter = new MyEmitter();
  const mockFn = jest.fn();
  emitter.on('done', mockFn);
  emitter.doWork(); // supposed to emit 'done'
  expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

---

## 📘 Real World Analogy

Think of an event emitter as a radio station:  
It emits events (like music or news).  
Any number of listeners (radios) can tune in to a specific broadcast.  
When the event happens, everyone listening hears it.

### What is EventEmitter?
`EventEmitter` is a core module in Node.js that allows different parts of your application to communicate asynchronously using events.

### Real-Life Analogy:
- **The band** is the event emitter.
- **The audience** are listeners.
- When the band plays a song (emits an event), the audience responds (listens and reacts).

### Practical Example:
Let’s say you're building a file upload system. When a file is uploaded, you might want to:
- Log the upload
- Send an email
- Resize the image

Instead of calling all those actions directly, you could emit an event called `fileUploaded`, and let other parts of your app handle the response:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

// Listener 1: log upload
emitter.on('fileUploaded', (file) => {
  console.log(`File uploaded: ${file.name}`);
});

// Listener 2: send email
emitter.on('fileUploaded', (file) => {
  console.log(`Sending email about: ${file.name}`);
});

// Emitting the event
const file = { name: 'profile.jpg' };
emitter.emit('fileUploaded', file);
```

---

## 🔹 Building a Mini Express-like Framework with EventEmitter

### Final Output Example:
```javascript
const app = createApp();

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Hello World!');
});

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Submitted!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### Implementation:
```javascript
const http = require('http');
const EventEmitter = require('events');

function createApp() {
  const emitter = new EventEmitter();

  const app = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    const routeKey = `${req.method} ${req.url}`;
    
    if (emitter.listenerCount(routeKey) > 0) {
      emitter.emit(routeKey, req, res);
    } else {
      res.statusCode = 404;
      res.end('Not Found');
    }
  });

  // Define route methods like get, post, etc.
  app.get = (path, handler) => {
    emitter.on(`GET ${path}`, handler);
  };

  app.post = (path, handler) => {
    emitter.on(`POST ${path}`, handler);
  };

  return app;
}
```

### Try It Out:
```javascript
const app = createApp();

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Hi from GET!');
});

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  res.end('Received POST!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Mini server running at http://localhost:3000');
});
```

## 🛍️ Real-World Scenario: E-commerce Order Processing System

**Goal:** Build a loosely-coupled system where different parts of the app (payment, inventory, email, analytics) react to an event like `"orderPlaced"`, but they don’t directly depend on each other.

---

### 🧱 System Components

| Component           | Responsibility                        |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Order Service**   | Places the order and emits `orderPlaced` |
| **Inventory Service** | Updates stock levels                  |
| **Email Service**   | Sends order confirmation              |
| **Analytics Service** | Logs event for BI/reporting           |

---

### 🧪 1. `eventBus.js` (Shared EventEmitter)

```javascript
// eventBus.js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
class EventBus extends EventEmitter {}
module.exports = new EventBus();
```
> This is a singleton event bus that all modules import and listen to.

---

### 🛒 2. `orderService.js`

```javascript
// orderService.js
const eventBus = require('./eventBus');

function placeOrder(userId, items) {
  // 1. Save order to DB
  console.log(`Order placed by user ${userId} for items`, items);

  // 2. Emit an event
  eventBus.emit('orderPlaced', { userId, items });
}

module.exports = { placeOrder };
```

---

### 📦 3. `inventoryService.js`

```javascript
// inventoryService.js
const eventBus = require('./eventBus');

eventBus.on('orderPlaced', ({ items }) => {
  items.forEach(item => {
    console.log(`Updating inventory for product ${item.productId}`);
    // DB: decrease stock count
  });
});
```

---

### 📧 4. `emailService.js`

```javascript
// emailService.js
const eventBus = require('./eventBus');

eventBus.on('orderPlaced', ({ userId }) => {
  console.log(`Sending order confirmation email to user ${userId}`);
  // Email service integration
});
```

---

### 📊 5. `analyticsService.js`

```javascript
// analyticsService.js
const eventBus = require('./eventBus');

eventBus.on('orderPlaced', ({ userId, items }) => {
  console.log(`Logging analytics for order:`, { userId, items });
  // Push to Kafka/BigQuery/etc.
});
```

---

### 🎯 6. `app.js` (Entry Point)

```javascript
// app.js
require('./inventoryService');
require('./emailService');
require('./analyticsService');

const { placeOrder } = require('./orderService');

placeOrder('user123', [
  { productId: 'P001', quantity: 2 },
  { productId: 'P002', quantity: 1 }
]);
```

---

### ✅ Benefits of This Design

- **Loose Coupling:** `orderService` doesn’t need to know about inventory, email, or analytics.
- **Extendability:** Add more listeners (e.g., SMS service) without touching order logic.
- **Testability:** Each service can be unit-tested by emitting fake events.
- **Performance:** All listeners are triggered synchronously but independently.
- **Clean Separation of Concerns:** Each service does one job.

## 🧠 EventEmitter vs Kafka: What's the Difference?

Think of it like this:

- **EventEmitter** is like talking inside one room—only those present (in the same Node.js process) can hear and react.
- **Kafka** is like broadcasting over a radio channel—other buildings (services) can tune in and receive the message, even if you leave the room.

---

### 🏗️ Real Use Case Comparison: Order Processing

#### 1. 🔧 Using EventEmitter (In-Process, Monolith Style)
- `orderService` emits `orderPlaced`.
- `emailService`, `inventoryService`, etc., listen via a shared `eventBus`.
- All logic runs in the same Node.js process.

**✅ Good for:**  
- Fast prototyping  
- Monolithic apps  
- Single-instance servers

**❌ Limitations:**  
- Not scalable across multiple Node.js processes or containers

---

#### 2. 🛰️ Using Kafka (Distributed Microservices)
- `orderService` produces an `order.placed` event to a Kafka topic.
- Other microservices subscribe (consume) to that topic:
  - `email-service` sends confirmation emails
  - `inventory-service` updates product quantities
  - `analytics-service` logs the order to BigQuery

**✅ Good for:**  
- Decoupled, distributed services  
- Retries and event replay  
- Scalability

**✅ Features:**  
- Built-in logging, monitoring, durability

**❌ Limitations:**  
- Requires infrastructure (Kafka brokers, setup)

## 🔹 What happens if an event handler throws an error?

### Answer:
If an event handler throws an error inside an `EventEmitter`, and the error is not caught, it can crash the Node.js process. Here's a breakdown:

- By default, `EventEmitter` does not handle exceptions in event listeners.
- If an exception is thrown and not caught inside a listener, it propagates and can cause the application to crash (uncaught exception).
- **Special case**: If the error occurs in a listener of the `error` event and there's no listener for `error`, Node.js will throw and terminate the process.

### Example:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.on('data', () => {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
});

emitter.emit('data'); // This will crash if not caught
```

### Best Practice:
Always wrap listener logic in `try/catch` if there's a risk of throwing:
```javascript
emitter.on('data', () => {
  try {
    // risky logic
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Handled error:', err);
  }
});
```

---

## 🔹 Can you build a Pub/Sub system using EventEmitter?

### Answer:
Yes, Node.js's built-in `EventEmitter` is a simple way to build a basic Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) system.

- **Publisher** emits events (messages).
- **Subscribers** register callbacks for those events.

### Example:
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const pubsub = new EventEmitter();

// Subscriber 1
pubsub.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('Subscriber 1 received:', data);
});

// Subscriber 2
pubsub.on('message', (data) => {
  console.log('Subscriber 2 received:', data);
});

// Publisher
pubsub.emit('message', 'Hello, world!');
```

### Limitations:
- It's in-process only — not distributed across multiple machines.
- No support for message persistence or delivery guarantees.

For more robust Pub/Sub systems, consider tools like Redis Pub/Sub, Kafka, RabbitMQ, or NATS.

## 🔹 Understanding Worker Threads in Node.js

### What Are Worker Threads?
Node.js is single-threaded by design. For CPU-intensive tasks like image processing or encryption, `worker_threads` allows you to run JavaScript in parallel on multiple threads.

### When to Use Worker Threads:
- Heavy computations (e.g., crypto, ML, parsing large files)
- Image or video processing
- Avoid blocking the event loop during synchronous tasks

---

## 🔹 Mini Project: Password Hasher with Worker Threads

### Project Structure:
```
password-hasher/
├── main.js            # Express server
├── hasher-worker.js   # Worker thread for hashing
├── package.json
```

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm init -y
npm install express bcrypt
```

### Step 2: Create `hasher-worker.js`
```javascript
const { parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

(async () => {
  try {
    const hashed = await bcrypt.hash(workerData.password, 10);
    parentPort.postMessage({ success: true, hashed });
  } catch (err) {
    parentPort.postMessage({ success: false, error: err.message });
  }
})();
```

### Step 3: Create `main.js`
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

function runHashWorker(password) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const worker = new Worker('./hasher-worker.js', {
      workerData: { password }
    });

    worker.on('message', (msg) => {
      if (msg.success) resolve(msg.hashed);
      else reject(new Error(msg.error));
    });

    worker.on('error', reject);
    worker.on('exit', code => {
      if (code !== 0) reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with code ${code}`));
    });
  });
}

app.post('/hash', async (req, res) => {
  const { password } = req.body;
  if (!password) return res.status(400).send('Password required');

  try {
    const hashed = await runHashWorker(password);
    res.send({ hashed });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).send({ error: err.message });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000'));
```

### Step 4: Test It
Use Postman or curl:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/hash -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"password": "secret123"}'
```
You should get a bcrypt hash back, generated in a worker thread ✅




## 🤝 Difference Between Promise and Promise.all

Both are used to handle asynchronous operations, but they differ in how they behave when dealing with multiple promises.

### ✅ Promise
A `Promise` represents a single asynchronous operation.

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve('Done'), 1000);
});

p.then(console.log); // logs "Done" after 1 sec
```

### ✅ Promise.all
`Promise.all` takes an array of promises and:
- Resolves when **all promises are fulfilled**.
- Rejects immediately if **any one fails**.

```javascript
const p1 = Promise.resolve(1);
const p2 = Promise.resolve(2);
const p3 = Promise.resolve(3);

Promise.all([p1, p2, p3]).then(values => {
  console.log(values); // [1, 2, 3]
});
```

### ❌ If One Fails
If any promise in the array rejects, `Promise.all` fails fast.

```javascript
const p1 = Promise.resolve('A');
const p2 = Promise.reject('Broke');
const p3 = Promise.resolve('C');

Promise.all([p1, p2, p3])
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(err => console.error(err)); // logs "Broke"
```

---

### ⚖️ Promise.all vs Other Promise Aggregators

| **Method**              | **Behavior**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Promise.all()`          | Waits for all to resolve. Fails fast on first rejection.                   |
| `Promise.allSettled()`   | Waits for all. Returns status/result of all (even failed).                 |
| `Promise.race()`         | Returns first resolved/rejected result. Doesn’t wait for all.              |
| `Promise.any()`          | Resolves with first successful one. Only rejects if all fail.             |

---

### 💡 When to Use What?

| **Use Case**                     | **Method**               |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| All must succeed                  | `Promise.all()`          |
| Need all results, even if some failed | `Promise.allSettled()`   |
| Proceed as soon as one completes  | `Promise.race()`         |
| Only care about the first success | `Promise.any()`          |

---

### 🔹 Real-world Scenario: Calling Multiple APIs in Parallel

Imagine a dashboard that shows:
- Weather info (`weatherAPI`)
- News headlines (`newsAPI`)
- Stock prices (`stocksAPI`)

You want to fetch all three simultaneously to improve performance:

```javascript
const [weather, news, stocks] = await Promise.all([
  fetchWeather(),
  fetchNews(),
  fetchStocks()
]);
```

✅ **Why it’s good**: It speeds up loading — no unnecessary waiting.  
❌ **But**: If any one fails, `Promise.all` fails fast, which leads to the next point...

---

### 🔹 Fail-fast Behavior of Promise.all

`Promise.all()` will reject immediately if any promise fails. It doesn’t wait for the others to complete.

```javascript
try {
  const [a, b, c] = await Promise.all([apiA(), apiB(), apiC()]);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('One failed, all failed:', err);
}
```

💡 **Good** when all results are required, but risky if partial success is acceptable.

---

### 🔹 Handling Individual Errors: Promise.allSettled

If you want all results, even if some fail:

```javascript
const results = await Promise.allSettled([
  fetchWeather(),
  fetchNews(),
  fetchStocks()
]);

results.forEach(result => {
  if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {
    console.log('Success:', result.value);
  } else {
    console.error('Failed:', result.reason);
  }
});
```

✅ **Use `allSettled` for**:
- User dashboards
- Background syncing
- Analytics jobs
- Aggregating 3rd-party API data

# Node.js Core Concepts: In-Depth Guide for Senior Developers

---

## 1. Node.js Runtime & Environment

### 🔍 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment** built on **Google's V8 JavaScript engine**. It allows developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js combines the power of C++, JavaScript, and libuv to deliver non-blocking, event-driven server-side functionality.

### ❓ Why It Matters

Understanding the runtime helps avoid performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and incorrect usage of async behavior. It empowers decisions about architecture, library choices, and deployment environments.

### ⚙️ How It Works

Node.js wraps the V8 engine and adds:

* **libuv**: Provides event loop, asynchronous I/O, and thread pooling.
* **Node APIs**: Implemented in C/C++, exposed to JavaScript (e.g., `fs`, `net`, `http`).
* **Bindings**: Connect C++ Node APIs to V8 for JS consumption.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Single JavaScript thread**
* **Asynchronous, non-blocking I/O**
* **Interoperability with system resources (file system, network, etc.)**

---

## 2. Node.js Architecture (Single-threaded, Event Loop)

### ❓ What is the Architecture?

Node.js operates on a **single-threaded event loop model** with a background worker thread pool for heavy I/O.

### ❓ Why It Exists

JavaScript was designed to be single-threaded for simplicity. Node.js leverages this with asynchronous I/O to manage high concurrency without multithreading complexity.

### ⚙️ How It Works

* JavaScript code runs on a single thread (main event loop).
* I/O and expensive operations are offloaded to background threads (via **libuv**).
* Once complete, callbacks are queued and executed on the main thread.

### 🧠 Implication

* Avoid CPU-heavy tasks on the main thread (use Worker Threads or offload to external services).
* Good for I/O-heavy workloads: web servers, APIs, streaming.

---

## 3. Call Stack, Event Loop, Callback Queue

### ❓ What Are These?

These components control **execution flow** in Node.js:

* **Call Stack**: The execution context stack (LIFO).
* **Event Loop**: The mechanism that schedules asynchronous code.
* **Callback Queue**: Queues up callbacks from async tasks to be executed by the event loop.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```javascript
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("nextTick"));
console.log("End");
```

**Output:**

```
Start
End
nextTick
Promise
Timeout
```

* `process.nextTick()` runs **before** Promises.
* Promises run in **microtask queue**.
* `setTimeout` runs in **macro task queue** after call stack clears.

### ❓ Why It Matters

Misunderstanding execution order leads to race conditions, missed optimizations, and unresponsive apps.

---

## 4. Libuv & Non-blocking I/O

### ❓ What is libuv?

**libuv** is a multi-platform C library that Node.js uses for:

* Asynchronous I/O
* Event loop
* Thread pooling
* File system & DNS abstraction
* TCP/UDP networking

### ⚙️ How It Works

Blocking tasks (e.g., file I/O) are offloaded to a **thread pool** (default size: 4). Upon completion, a callback is placed in the event loop queue.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Done reading');
});
```

### ❓ Why It Matters

Node.js is not truly single-threaded—libuv's thread pool runs in the background. Knowing this helps when tuning concurrency and thread pool size.

### ⚠️ Tuning Tips

* Use `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` to increase thread pool size for heavy I/O apps.
* Avoid synchronous functions (`fs.readFileSync`) on the main thread.

---

## 5. Global Objects (\_\_dirname, \_\_filename, process, etc.)

### ❓ What Are They?

Node.js provides global variables and objects without requiring imports.

| Global         | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `__dirname`    | Directory of the current module            |
| `__filename`   | Full path to the current module            |
| `process`      | Process-level info, environment, lifecycle |
| `global`       | Like `window` in the browser               |
| `Buffer`       | For working with binary data               |
| `setImmediate` | Executes after current event loop phase    |

### ⚙️ How & Why To Use Them

```js
console.log(__dirname);              // Useful for path resolution
console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV);  // Environment config
process.on('exit', code => console.log('Exiting:', code));
```

* Use `process.env` for **environment-specific configurations**.
* Use `__dirname`/`__filename` for safe **file path handling**.
* Use `Buffer` when dealing with streams, binary protocols, or raw I/O.

### 🧠 Real-world Use Cases

* `.env` based configuration using `dotenv`
* Graceful shutdown using `process.on('SIGTERM')`
* Serving static files with proper `__dirname` resolution

---

## 6. 🧠 Performance & Internals

### 🔄 Event Loop Internals (Phases, Timers, Microtasks)

#### ❓ What It Is

The event loop is the heartbeat of Node.js. It manages when and how callbacks are executed.

#### ⚙️ How It Works

Node.js's event loop has multiple phases:

1. **Timers Phase**: Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.
2. **Pending Callbacks Phase**: Executes I/O callbacks deferred from the previous cycle.
3. **Idle/Prepare Phase**: Only for internal use.
4. **Poll Phase**: Waits for new I/O events; executes immediate I/O callbacks.
5. **Check Phase**: Executes `setImmediate` callbacks.
6. **Close Callbacks Phase**: Executes callbacks like `socket.on('close')`.

In between these phases:

* **Microtasks** (like `Promise.then`, `queueMicrotask`) are executed **after each phase**.
* `process.nextTick` runs **before microtasks**.

#### 🧠 Why It Matters

Mastery of event loop timing helps avoid unexpected bugs, especially with multiple timers, promises, and I/O.

---

### 🧵 Node.js Clustering & Multi-threading

#### ❓ What It Is

* **Cluster Module**: Allows Node.js to spawn child processes (forks) that share the same server port.
* **Worker Threads**: Provides actual multi-threading within a single process.

#### ⚙️ How It Works

* **Cluster**: Uses `child_process.fork()` and load balances incoming connections using round-robin.

```js
const cluster = require('cluster');
if (cluster.isMaster) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) cluster.fork();
} else {
  require('./server');
}
```

* **Worker Threads**: Runs CPU-intensive JS in parallel.

```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
new Worker('./heavy-task.js');
```

#### 🧠 Why It Matters

Cluster is ideal for scaling network-bound apps. Worker threads are for CPU-bound logic (e.g., image processing, data crunching).

### 🚀 V8 Optimizations

#### ❓ What It Is

V8 is the engine behind Node.js that compiles JavaScript to machine code using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

#### ⚙️ How It Works

* Optimizes frequently used functions (hot code).
* Performs inlining, dead code elimination, hidden classes, and escape analysis.
* Falls back to interpreted code on de-optimization.

#### 🧠 Why It Matters

Understanding V8 helps in writing performance-critical code.

**Tips:**

* Avoid polymorphism (inconsistent property usage).
* Pre-allocate arrays or buffers.
* Don’t abuse `arguments` or `eval`.
* Use `let`/`const` over `var`.

---

### 🧹 Garbage Collection in Node.js

#### ❓ What It Is

Automatic memory management by V8 through generational garbage collection.

#### ⚙️ How It Works

* V8 uses **generational GC**:

  * **New Space (Young Gen)**: Short-lived objects.
  * **Old Space (Tenured Gen)**: Long-lived objects.
* Minor GC: Fast, runs often on young gen.
* Major GC: Slow, scans entire heap.

#### 🧠 Why It Matters

Improper memory handling causes GC pauses and leaks.

**Tips:**

* Avoid holding unnecessary references.
* Use tools like `--inspect`, `heapdump`, `v8-profiler`, `clinic.js` to monitor memory.
* Trigger GC manually only in diagnostics: `--expose-gc`, then `global.gc()`.

## 1. Node.js Runtime & Environment

### 🔍 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment** built on **Google's V8 JavaScript engine**. It allows developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript. Node.js combines the power of C++, JavaScript, and libuv to deliver non-blocking, event-driven server-side functionality.

### ❓ Why It Matters

Understanding the runtime helps avoid performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and incorrect usage of async behavior. It empowers decisions about architecture, library choices, and deployment environments.

### ⚙️ How It Works

Node.js wraps the V8 engine and adds:

* **libuv**: Provides event loop, asynchronous I/O, and thread pooling.
* **Node APIs**: Implemented in C/C++, exposed to JavaScript (e.g., `fs`, `net`, `http`).
* **Bindings**: Connect C++ Node APIs to V8 for JS consumption.

### 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Single JavaScript thread**
* **Asynchronous, non-blocking I/O**
* **Interoperability with system resources (file system, network, etc.)**

---

## 2. Node.js Architecture (Single-threaded, Event Loop)

### ❓ What is the Architecture?

Node.js operates on a **single-threaded event loop model** with a background worker thread pool for heavy I/O.

### ❓ Why It Exists

JavaScript was designed to be single-threaded for simplicity. Node.js leverages this with asynchronous I/O to manage high concurrency without multithreading complexity.

### ⚙️ How It Works

* JavaScript code runs on a single thread (main event loop).
* I/O and expensive operations are offloaded to background threads (via **libuv**).
* Once complete, callbacks are queued and executed on the main thread.

### 🧠 Implication

* Avoid CPU-heavy tasks on the main thread (use Worker Threads or offload to external services).
* Good for I/O-heavy workloads: web servers, APIs, streaming.

---

## 3. Call Stack, Event Loop, Callback Queue

### ❓ What Are These?

These components control **execution flow** in Node.js:

* **Call Stack**: The execution context stack (LIFO).
* **Event Loop**: The mechanism that schedules asynchronous code.
* **Callback Queue**: Queues up callbacks from async tasks to be executed by the event loop.

### ⚙️ How It Works

```javascript
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("nextTick"));
console.log("End");
```

**Output:**

```
Start
End
nextTick
Promise
Timeout
```

* `process.nextTick()` runs **before** Promises.
* Promises run in **microtask queue**.
* `setTimeout` runs in **macro task queue** after call stack clears.

### ❓ Why It Matters

Misunderstanding execution order leads to race conditions, missed optimizations, and unresponsive apps.

---

## 4. Libuv & Non-blocking I/O

### ❓ What is libuv?

**libuv** is a multi-platform C library that Node.js uses for:

* Asynchronous I/O
* Event loop
* Thread pooling
* File system & DNS abstraction
* TCP/UDP networking

### ⚙️ How It Works

Blocking tasks (e.g., file I/O) are offloaded to a **thread pool** (default size: 4). Upon completion, a callback is placed in the event loop queue.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Done reading');
});
```

### ❓ Why It Matters

Node.js is not truly single-threaded—libuv's thread pool runs in the background. Knowing this helps when tuning concurrency and thread pool size.

### ⚠️ Tuning Tips

* Use `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` to increase thread pool size for heavy I/O apps.
* Avoid synchronous functions (`fs.readFileSync`) on the main thread.

---

## 5. Global Objects (\_\_dirname, \_\_filename, process, etc.)

### ❓ What Are They?

Node.js provides global variables and objects without requiring imports.

| Global         | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `__dirname`    | Directory of the current module            |
| `__filename`   | Full path to the current module            |
| `process`      | Process-level info, environment, lifecycle |
| `global`       | Like `window` in the browser               |
| `Buffer`       | For working with binary data               |
| `setImmediate` | Executes after current event loop phase    |

### ⚙️ How & Why To Use Them

```js
console.log(__dirname);              // Useful for path resolution
console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV);  // Environment config
process.on('exit', code => console.log('Exiting:', code));
```

* Use `process.env` for **environment-specific configurations**.
* Use `__dirname`/`__filename` for safe **file path handling**.
* Use `Buffer` when dealing with streams, binary protocols, or raw I/O.

### 🧠 Real-world Use Cases

* `.env` based configuration using `dotenv`
* Graceful shutdown using `process.on('SIGTERM')`
* Serving static files with proper `__dirname` resolution

## 7. 🧰 Streams

### 📖 What Are Streams?

Streams are abstract interfaces for working with streaming data in Node.js. They're instances of `EventEmitter` and allow **data processing chunk-by-chunk** instead of loading it all at once into memory.

### 💡 Why Streams Matter

Efficient for large file I/O, network transmission, or transformation tasks like video encoding. Helps with memory usage and performance.

### 🔄 Types of Streams

* **Readable**: Source of data (e.g., `fs.createReadStream`)
* **Writable**: Destination of data (e.g., `fs.createWriteStream`)
* **Duplex**: Both readable and writable (e.g., TCP socket)
* **Transform**: Duplex + transformation (e.g., Gzip compression)

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const read = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
const write = fs.createWriteStream('copy.txt');
read.pipe(write);
```

### ⏱️ Backpressure

Occurs when the writable stream can't consume data as fast as readable stream produces.

```js
const stream = require('stream');
readable.pipe(writable, { end: false });
```

Node handles this via `.pause()`, `.resume()`, and internal buffering.

### 🔄 Piping Streams

Connect output of one stream to another. Simplifies transformation pipelines.

```js
readable.pipe(transform).pipe(writable);
```

Useful for:

* Compression (Gzip)
* Encryption
* Parsing CSV/JSON/NDJSON

---

## 8. 🔒 Security

### 🛡️ Input Validation & Sanitization

Always validate and sanitize input, especially in REST or GraphQL APIs.

* Use libraries like `Joi`, `zod`, `express-validator`
* Prevent NoSQL/SQL injection

```js
const Joi = require('joi');
const schema = Joi.object({ username: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).required() });
```

### 💥 Preventing Memory Leaks

* Dereference unused objects
* Use `WeakMap`/`WeakRef`
* Monitor heap snapshots

Use tools like:

* Chrome DevTools (`--inspect`)
* `heapdump`
* `clinic.js`

### 📉 Rate Limiting

Prevent abuse by limiting requests:

* Use `express-rate-limit`
* Implement IP-based or token-based quotas

```js
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
app.use(rateLimit({ windowMs: 1 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 }));
```

### 🔐 HTTPS & TLS/SSL

Use `https` module or reverse proxies (e.g., NGINX) for TLS.

* Always redirect HTTP to HTTPS
* Rotate TLS keys
* Use `helmet` for common HTTP headers

### ☠️ CSRF/XSS in Backend APIs

* CSRF: Use tokens for stateful APIs
* XSS: Sanitize output, use Content Security Policy

---

## 9. 🌐 Networking

### 🔌 TCP & UDP (Net, Dgram)

* **TCP (net module)**: Reliable, ordered, stream-based communication

```js
const net = require('net');
net.createServer(socket => socket.write('Hello')).listen(3000);
```

* **UDP (dgram module)**: Fast, connectionless

```js
const dgram = require('dgram');
const socket = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
socket.send('Hello', 41234, 'localhost');
```

### 🧵 WebSockets

Enable full-duplex communication between client/server.

* `ws`: Lightweight and low-level

```js
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const server = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });
```

* `Socket.IO`: Adds room support, reconnection, fallback protocols

Use when you need:

* Real-time apps (chats, games)
* Live data (stocks, feeds)

### 🚀 HTTP/2 Support

* Built-in Node.js support via `http2` module
* Multiplexing: multiple streams per connection
* Server push capabilities

```js
const http2 = require('http2');
http2.createSecureServer({ cert, key }, onRequest);
```

---

## 10. 🛠️ Process & Threads

### 👶 `child_process` Module

Spawn new OS processes (shell commands, subprocesses)

```js
const { exec, spawn } = require('child_process');
exec('ls -la', (err, stdout) => console.log(stdout));
```

Use `spawn` for streams, `exec` for buffered output.

### 🧵 `worker_threads`

True multi-threading within Node.js for CPU-bound work.

```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
new Worker('./worker.js');
```

Best for:

* CPU-heavy JSON parsing
* Math calculations
* Encryption tasks

### 🔄 Spawning vs Forking

* **Spawn**: Launch any executable with streaming I/O
* **Fork**: Specialized spawn for Node.js child scripts

```js
const { fork } = require('child_process');
fork('child.js');
```

### ⚙️ Parallelism in Node.js

* Use `Promise.all` for async I/O concurrency
* Use `cluster` or `worker_threads` for CPU-parallelism
* Thread pool can handle background libuv tasks (e.g., crypto, fs)
