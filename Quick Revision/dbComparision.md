# üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Design: Choosing Between SQL and NoSQL

## ‚úÖ SQL vs NoSQL: Quick Summary

| Feature          | SQL (Relational)               | NoSQL (Non-relational)          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Schema**       | Fixed schema (structured)      | Dynamic schema (flexible)       |
| **Relationships**| Strong (joins, constraints)    | Weak or manual (denormalized data) |
| **Scaling**      | Vertical (traditionally)       | Horizontal (easy to scale out)  |
| **Query Language**| SQL (standard)                | Varies (MongoQL, CQL, etc.)     |
| **ACID**         | Full ACID support              | Often eventual consistency      |

## üîç When to Use SQL

Use a relational DB (like PostgreSQL, MySQL) when:

- You have strong relationships (e.g., users ‚Üî orders)
- Need data integrity (banking, inventory)
- Want to enforce schemas (structured, tabular data)
- Complex queries with joins, subqueries

### üß† Example: E-commerce Backend

```sql
Users(id, name, email)
Orders(id, user_id, total)
Products(id, name, price)
```

## üîç When to Use NoSQL

Use NoSQL (like MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB) when:

- Data is unstructured or semi-structured
- Need fast write-heavy performance (logging, analytics)
- Want to scale horizontally
- You prefer schema-less flexibility

### üß† Example: Logging System

```json
{
    "user_id": "abc123",
    "action": "clicked_button",
    "timestamp": 1687501720
}
```

## ‚ú® Design Example: Instagram-like App

### SQL

- **Users Table**
- **Posts Table**
- **Follows Table**
- **Likes Table**

**Pros:**
- Query who follows whom
- Enforce constraints (e.g., user must exist before liking a post)

---

### NoSQL (MongoDB)

```json
// posts collection
{
    "post_id": 1,
    "user_id": "abc",
    "image_url": "...",
    "likes": [ "u1", "u2", "u3" ] // denormalized
}
```

**Pros:**
- Fast reads for feed
- Store post + comments + likes in a single document
