# üìä Comparative Overview

| **Feature**            | **Apache Kafka**                                                                 | **RabbitMQ**                                                                                   | **Amazon SQS**                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**        | Distributed log-based system with partitioned topics and persistent storage.     | Message broker with queues and exchanges, supporting various messaging protocols.              | Fully managed message queuing service with standard and FIFO queues.                               |
| **Message Retention**   | Messages retained for a configurable period (default 7 days), allowing replay.   | Messages are removed once acknowledged; no built-in replay capability.                         | Messages retained for up to 14 days; once consumed, they are deleted.                              |
| **Throughput**          | High throughput, capable of handling millions of messages per second.            | Moderate throughput; suitable for typical enterprise workloads.                                | Scalable throughput, but with some limitations; suitable for most applications.                    |
| **Latency**             | Low latency suitable for real-time processing.                                   | Low latency; efficient for quick message delivery.                                             | Slightly higher latency due to its distributed nature and eventual consistency model.               |
| **Ordering Guarantees** | Guarantees ordering within partitions.                                           | Supports message ordering through specific configurations.                                     | FIFO queues ensure ordering; standard queues do not guarantee ordering.                            |
| **Scalability**         | Highly scalable horizontally by adding more brokers and partitions.              | Scalable, but may require more effort to manage as load increases.                             | Automatically scales with demand; managed by AWS.                                                  |
| **Durability & Reliability** | High durability with message replication across brokers.                     | Reliable message delivery with acknowledgments; supports clustering for high availability.     | High durability with messages stored redundantly across multiple AWS availability zones.           |
| **Protocol Support**    | Uses its own protocol; integrates well with various systems via Kafka Connect.    | Supports multiple protocols like AMQP, MQTT, STOMP.                                           | Uses AWS-specific APIs; integrates seamlessly with other AWS services.                             |
| **Management Complexity** | Requires setup and management of clusters; more complex to operate.            | Easier to set up; management complexity increases with scale.                                  | Fully managed by AWS; minimal operational overhead.                                                 |
| **Cost Considerations** | Open-source; operational costs depend on infrastructure and management.           | Open-source; costs associated with hosting and maintenance.                                   | Pay-as-you-go pricing; cost-effective for variable workloads.                                      |

## üß† How Kafka Stores Messages

Kafka is fundamentally a distributed log system ‚Äî think of it as a giant, highly scalable commit log.

### How It Works Step by Step

1. **Topic**  
    Messages are published to topics.  
    Think of a topic like a category or stream name (e.g., `order_placed`, `lecture_chat`).

2. **Partition**  
    Each topic is split into partitions.  
    A partition is an append-only log file. Messages are added to the end of this log ‚Äî just like writing new lines to a file.  
    Example:  
    `order_placed` topic ‚Üí 3 partitions ‚Üí Messages are distributed among them.

3. **Brokers**  
    A Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers (servers).  
    Each broker stores some partitions. Kafka ensures replication ‚Äî multiple brokers can store copies of a partition for fault tolerance.

### üíæ Where Are Messages Actually Stored?

#### üîπ On Disk (Persistent Storage)  
Kafka stores messages on disk, not just in memory.  
It‚Äôs fast because it uses sequential disk I/O ‚Äî appending data is very efficient.  

- **Segment Files**: Large partitions are split into smaller segment files (e.g., 1GB each).  
- **Indexing**: Each segment has an associated index for fast lookup.

#### üîπ Filesystem Structure  
Example structure for a partition:  
```
/kafka-logs/order_placed-0/
  - 00000000000000000000.log       # Actual message data
  - 00000000000000000000.index     # Maps message offsets to byte positions
  - 00000000000000000000.timeindex # Maps timestamps to offsets (for time-based queries)
```

---

### üïí How Kafka Retains Messages

Kafka is not a queue that deletes messages once consumed. Instead, retention is time-based or size-based, not consumer-based.

#### üîÅ Retention Policies

1. **Time-Based Retention**  
    ```bash
    retention.ms = 604800000  # 7 days
    ```
    Messages are kept for 7 days, even if already read.

2. **Size-Based Retention**  
    ```bash
    retention.bytes = 1073741824  # 1 GB per partition
    ```
    If the log size exceeds 1GB, older segments are deleted.

#### üßº Log Cleanup  
Kafka deletes entire segments, not individual messages ‚Äî much more efficient.

---

### üîé Message Offset

Each message in Kafka has an offset, which is like a line number in the log.  
Offsets are per partition, and consumers keep track of their own offset (not Kafka).  

This allows consumers to:  
- Resume from the last processed offset.  
- Re-read old messages (for replay).  
- Parallelize consumption by partition.

#### üîê Example  
You publish this to the `lecture_started` topic:  
```json
{
  "event": "lecture_started",
  "lectureId": "xyz123",
  "startTime": "2025-04-22T12:00:00Z"
}
```
Kafka stores this message in `lecture_started-0.log` at offset 245.  

If your notification service crashes, when it comes back, it re-reads from offset 245 and keeps going.  
Even if it's read, the message stays for 7 days (or whatever your config is).

### ‚úÖ Summary

| **Concept**   | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Storage**   | Messages are stored on disk, in partitioned logs, inside segment files.         |
| **Retention** | Based on time or size, not whether it was consumed.                             |
| **Durability**| Messages are replicated across brokers for fault tolerance.                    |
| **Replayable**| Consumers can re-read old messages anytime within the retention window.         |
